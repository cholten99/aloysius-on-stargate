<P>She stares at me with eyes of coal, this creature I have created.  There is murder in those eyes, and hatred, directed solely at me.  My gaze slips to the manacles clamped around her wrists; I test in my mind the strength of the chains that hold her to the wall.</P>

<P>As if reading my thoughts, she lets out a shriek of pure rage and leaps forwards, straining against her bonds.  I jump backwards involuntarily, even though I am already on the other side of the room, and a smile of triumph twists her pale features.  She bares her sharp teeth, salivating at my fear, taking no end of pleasure in my discomfort.</P>

<P>I should be the one in control here.  I hold her captive, this being to whom I granted the gift of life, if this violence-driven, savage existence can be called that.  I have absolute power over her survival, and yet she rules me completely.</P>

<P>She is altogether evil, I see that now, but I do not have it in me to destroy that which I have created.  And so, I am trapped just as surely as she, doomed to serve her every need, even as she plots my demise.</P>

<P>She laughs at my terror and then cries at her own torment; I mock my own weakness and weep for her soul.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
