<P>The picture of Blair in his natural habitat at the beginning of this episode is wonderful.  His warehouse is very much student abode, and the fingerless gloves tell their own story of lack of funds for heating.  The way he talks to Larry is as much him airing his thoughts on his research aloud as it is actual conversation with the ape – we already know Blair talks to himself, which is another of his habits that I love.</P>

<P>The way he says &quot;helloooo&quot; into the intercom is adorable.  Jim identifies himself as &quot;Ellison&quot;, which demonstrates that he’s still not as comfortable with Blair as Blair is with him.</P>

<P>Jim’s entrance into the warehouse tells us a couple of interesting things:</P>

<UL>

<UL>
<LI>he’s borrowed a video camera from Carolyn to help Blair with his project, showing their deepening friendship</LI>
<LI>on seeing Larry, Jim says, &quot;Who’s this?&quot;, acknowledging Larry as an individual with a personality</LI></UL>
</UL>


<P>Classic banter:</P>
<P>Blair: The behavioural pattern of a Barbary ape is, like, remarkably similar to that of a human being.</P>
<P>Jim: Maybe in your family tree.</P>

<P>Blair’s description of his rodent housemates is really funny, and I like Jim’s horror at Blair’s living conditions.  It may just be his anally neat side reacting, but I also detect the smallest hint of concern.</P>

<P>Further example of Blair refusing to be intimidated by Jim – he doesn’t even come close to being manipulated into getting Jim a beer.  The picture of them sitting on the couch together watching the movie is very cute, and I like the fact that Larry is snuggling up to Jim rather than Blair.  An affinity to animals is a very attractive quality.</P>

<P>We get another high body count in the attack on the drug lag – this show really doesn’t pull any punches in its portrayal of crime, despite the lack of actual onscreen violence.</P>

<P>Jim often gets portrayed in fanfic as stand-offish and anti-social, but he’s very friendly and personable when Simon introduces him to the men from the anti-gangs unit.  He actually looks a little hurt by Gaines’ brush-off.</P>

<P>Only Blair could live next door to a drug lab and not have a clue.  His naivety here is very cute.</P>

<P>Then we get the famous ‘one week’ conversation.  The fact that Jim doesn’t immediately offer to let Blair stay with him is a little harsh, but we already know he values his peace and privacy at the loft, so it’s understandable that he’d be reluctant to have a roommate.  Blair being able to persuade him without too much trouble is indicative of his ability to influence Jim, and the fact that the ‘one week’ turns into three and a half years with no explanation says a lot about their developing relationship.  Imagining Blair upstairs in the double bed rather than down in the spare room isn’t really too much of a stretch!</P>

<P>Jim’s subsequent complaints about Blair to Joel in the bullpen have a definite air of a distraction about them, if you ask me – he’s setting up the reluctant host persona so no-one guesses the truth about Blair living with him…</P>

<P>This show does a good job of presenting characters as sympathetic even though their behaviour is hostile or unpleasant – the conversation between Gaines and Antoine show a lot of the softer side of Gaines and gives us more background to his character, and then the death of his friend goes a long way to making us feel sorry for him.  He’s a well-drawn and interesting one-off character, which is something you get a lot in this show, and not always in other shows where the peripheral characters don’t get much attention or detail.</P>

<P>Jim shows great perception and understanding when he tells Simon not to take Gaines’ verbal attack personally – he really is quite a sensitive guy despite his hard exterior.</P>

<P>The scene between Jim and Blair at the loft is funny, but it presents Jim as the sensible dad to Blair’s irresponsible teenager, which is most definitely *not* how I like to view them!  Jim does describe Blair cooking breakfast as a &quot;courtship ritual&quot; in the very next scene, though, so things quickly get back to how they should be presented.</P>

<P>Blair’s subtle emotional blackmail when talking about moving back out shows how he probably manipulates Jim gradually into letting him stay, and I bet the cooked breakfast makes a difference, despite Jim’s protestations to the contrary.  The fact that Blair already knows how Jim like his eggs is fairly telling, too.</P>

<P>Their conversation about the gangs is great – even though Blair hasn’t been helping out on the case, he still knows everything that’s happened, which means Jim must have been talking to him about it anyway, and even though Jim deliberately misinterprets Blair’s anthropological lecture at first, he quickly becomes absorbed by what Blair’s saying, and accepts the ideas he presents.  The signs of a true partnership are all there.</P>

<P>Gaines gets even more advantageous presentation when we see him coaching the neighbourhood kids and not allowing gang colours in the group.  The exchange of apologies between Jim and Gaines is very well done – they’re both stubborn men who are sometimes unwilling to entertain someone else’s point of view, but they find mutual respect and understanding here.  Gaines calling Jim &quot;Die Hard&quot; is really cool – it’s not often that Jim gets a nickname and I like this one.</P>

<P>Following up the mutual gaining of respect by immediately casting suspicion on Gaines is a clever way of keeping the tension high – Jim is now much more inclined to defend Gaines, setting him against the standard operating procedures that Simon is forced to follow.</P>

<P>There’s definitely something missing in this episode and it wasn’t until the scene in Gaines’ apartment that I realised what it was – all of the scenes at the police station or with Jim working on the case are missing a vital ingredient, namely Blair.  It’s really weird for him not to be there, piping up with his two cents’ worth whether it’s asked for or not, and annoying the hell our of Simon with his unorthodox investigation techniques.</P>

<P>However, his next appearance is well worth waiting for.  Blair’s social services act is absolutely adorable – and shows a marked change in Jim’s faith in him.  Earlier, he didn’t want Blair involved in the case because he thought he’d be ‘over his head’ – now he’s despatching Blair to protect a possible target of gang assassins!  As usual, Blair comes up with the perfect story to get past the opposition at the door, and the shot of Jim listening in and watching over him is lovely.</P>

<P>Blair meets his match in Gaines’ grandmother, but in true opportunistic style he turns the situation to his advantage and alters the plan to set up the best solution to the problem with the resources at hand.</P>

<P>Then we get some wonderful interplay – at the first sign of trouble:</P>
<P>Jim: I want you out of there, Sandburg.</P>
<P>But once again Blair gets his own way, demonstrating the courage he usually does his best to pretend he doesn’t have.</P>

<P>Blair’s really cute with Gaines’ grandmother – he seems ever so slightly out of his depth and is obviously rather nervous about his plan, but he deals with the situation beautifully, letting the Safety Committee run off the gang members by themselves.  He’s a brilliant teacher – he knows exactly when to let people stand on their own, with only his watchful presence making sure nothing goes wrong.</P>

<P>Jim and Gaines make a pretty good team in the end, but I’d still prefer it if Jim was working with Blair.</P>

<P>Simon’s reaction to Gaines being in Jim’s loft is a little extreme, though I suppose it doesn’t take much for Jim to calm him down and get him to listen.  I guess the initial reaction is just Simon’s by the book cop instincts taking over before his brain kicks in.  He’s not as used to bending the rules as Jim, which is probably why he’s the captain, but he trusts Jim like always.</P>

<P>Jim does his action man bit fairly impressively at the end, but he doesn’t really use his senses all that much in this episode – or maybe it’s just that Blair isn’t there to comment on it so it’s not so obvious.</P>

<P>Jim’s praise of Blair in the tag is lovely, as is Blair’s insistence that he doesn’t deserve it.  Then Jim’s good humour about Larry reappearing at the loft and Blair’s automatic focus on the scientific ramifications give us a brilliant interaction to end the episode.</P>

<P>Blair’s not in it enough, and is separated from Jim way too much, but who can knock the episode where they move in together?</P>
