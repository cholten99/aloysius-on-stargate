<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We get intrigue and excitement right from the start – two soldiers discussing the fate of a downed helicopter in low lighting.  It doesn’t get much more atmospheric than that!</P>

<P>Mathis is a smart cookie and a good commander.  He’s obviously sensitive enough to be bothered by the idea of digging up eighteen-month-old dead bodies, he’s quick to ensure the safety of his men when they’re fired upon, but he recognises very rapidly that the Chopec are not exerting lethal force on them.  He takes a risk in telling his men to cease fire and putting them at the mercy of the natives, but it’s a calculated one, and it pays off.</P>

<P>And then we get our first glimpse of our hero – he appears in full-on Jungle Jim mode – WOOF!  I’m not normally a fan of muscled action men, but this one has my heart beating faster right from the start, even before we discover there’s so much more to him than his muscles!</P>

<P>Jim demonstrates use of his heightened senses even before he gets a line, and the premise of the show starts to become clear at last, though it actually takes the entire episode to set it up fully – a really good build up, if you ask me.</P>

<P>Jim has a lovely voice – it’s rich and full, and contains a great deal of depth, with an every so slightly gravelly edge that hints at both toughness and sensitivity.  Very yummy!</P>

<P>We move suddenly from the Peruvian jungle to the Pacific Northwest of America – a shift from tropical rainforest to the land of flannel shirts and woolly sweaters.  Bit of a shame for a newly discovered fan of Jim’s muscles, but hey – you can’t win ‘em all!</P>

<P>Simon’s introduction is businesslike, direct and forecful – here we have the leader of the group of characters, confident and secure in his position.  This, of course, is before he encounters The Sandburg Zone!  I like Simon a lot – he makes a very good third wheel to the Jim/Blair vehicle, an excellent counterpoint to their characters.</P>

<P>Revealing a character’s traits by having other characters talk about him is a good technique.  Not only does it provide useful information to the viewer, but also demonstrates how he fits into the rest of the group.  From the outset, Jim is presented as isolated, a loner, regareded either with awe or frustration by those around him – this sets things perfectly for the explosion of Blair onto the scene later on.</P>

<P>We get to see Jim’s more aggressive side when the other policemen can’t smell the gas in the warehouse.  He really doesn’t like things being out of his control, so it’s understandable that his senses being on the fritz would be driving him mad, over and above the physical discomfort.</P>

<P>Another thing I like about Jim – he has beautiful eyes and, while we don’t get too many shots of his muscles, there’s an abundance of close-ups of his lovely eyes.</P>

<P>Action Man Jim comes into effect with his athletic leap onto the motorbike, but it’s shortlived, showing just how much his senses are affecting his work.  This whole sequence is a really good demonstration of the situation – it shows how useful the heightened senses could be, but also how detrimental they are without control.  Once again, setting up the need for Blair.</P>

<P>Carolyn’s never made much of an impression on me.  There’s nothing overtly wrong with her as a character, it’s just that there isn’t really a place for a woman in the show at the moment, and she’s not exactly scintillating.  She’s interesting from the point of view of providing insight into Jim’s background, but I don’t have any interest in her as a character in her own right.</P>

<P>There’s lots of information floating about in this episode, but it’s cleverly revealed so we don’t get overloaded with exposition.  Example:</P>

<P>Simon: The only thing I want more than my divorce papers is an arrest.</P>

<P>Simon’s divorce becomes important in later episodes, but here it’s just casually thrown into the dialogue so we absorb it without even really thinking about it.</P>

<P>Simon doesn’t make it easy for Jim – the poor guy is asking for help and even going so far as to admit he’s scared, and Simon comes back at him first with dismissal and then with intolerance.  I know Simon’s in a tough position, but the whole exchange seems a little harsh to me.</P>

<P>Stonewall Ellison gets a look-in at the restaurant, yet again building things up to demonstrate just how much impact Blair has on the status quo.  The episode goes for a huge amount of time without it’s second star, but that only serves to increase the anticipation and heighten the impact when he finally does appear.</P>

<P>Carolyn’s comment about the kiss always makes me laugh because it looks like a totally awaful kiss to me!</P>

<P>The brief glimpse of Jim’s impressive physique in the hospital is completely overshadowed by the long-awaited first glimpse of the real reason for my love affair with this show – Blair!!  Woohoo!  Small but perfectly formed, he’s quite possibly the most adorable guy I’ve ever come across, and this forst shot tells us a great deal about him – the scruffy shoes and the air of nervousness give away that he’s not what he appears and his subsequent conversation with Jim reveals loads of his most adorable characteristics:</P>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>ridiculous obfuscation over pronounciation of his assumed name</LI>
<LI>talking a mile a minute</LI>
<LI>barely suppressed excitement over his discovery</LI>
<LI>total lack of regard for personal boundaries</LI></UL>
</UL>


<P>He enters the scene like a whirlwind of scientific enthusiasm and isn’t in the least bit put off by Jim’s aggressive brush off.  There’s no discouraging this guy!  He’s most definitely the irresistible force to Jim’s immovable object, and he wins pretty much every time.</P>

<P>Just in case we’d forgotten there’s a criminal on the loose during the excitement of finally meeting Blair, we then get anonymous hands making a bomb – oh yes, it’s a cop show, isn’t it?  Bomber to catch – right, got it!</P>

<P>Our second viewing of Blair is even more characteristic – hair loose, bopping along to his weird tribal music, this is the anthropologist we come to know and love.  Chaotic energiser bunny meets anal stoic – what a great partnership prospect, and also a match made in heaven!</P>

<P>Jim starts calling Blair &quot;Chief&quot; right from the beginning, though here it’s a dismissive and slightly derogatory term, but later becomes a sign of affection.</P>

<P>Not even being slammed into a wall shakes Blair’s determination – I’m pretty sure Jim’s never come across anyone he couldn’t intimidate before, and it must be quite a shock to the system!</P>

<P>Once Blair gets into his exploration of Sentinels, the joky nervousness disappears and the passion for his subject shines through.  The volubility is still there bigtime, but it’s more focused and you can see that he can be really persuasive, and probably makes a very compelling teacher.  His conviction is absolute, and that’s always attractive to me.</P>

<P>Then Blair reveals the true mettle of his character by throwing himself under a truck in order to stop Jim from being run over.  The final piece fits into place and you know this is going to be a brilliant partnership.</P>

<P>Blair: You’re a human crime lab with organic surveillance equipment.</P>
<P>Cool!  So that’s how the show’s going to work!</P>

<P>Now, I hate fanfiction that presents Blair as weak and feminine (because he’s far from either), but I have to admit he’s incredibly beautiful looking up into Jim’s face with those big blue eyes and, although I could and would never immasculate him in fic, I suppose I can just about see where the tendency comes from here.</P>

<P>Jim’s possessiveness comes into play early on, too – when Blair asks him to listen in on what the blonde TA is saying about him, he lies so as to keep Blair to himself.  That’s my interpretation anyway – and I’m sticking to it!!</P>

<P>Joel makes his first appearance in characteristically modest fashion, taking Simon’s praise and redirecting it to Carolyn.  A good, honest, dependable guy – and one of many great peripheral characters that help to round out the show.</P>

<P>The first instance of Simon’s classic sarcastic smile turns up after the bomb goes off.  He’s got a very dry sense of humour, part of how well drawn all the characters are.  It’s most definitely a character-driven show.</P>

<P>Blair: Now I’m just gonna shut up and let you feel it out.</P>
<P>Blair, shut up?  That’s got to be a first!!</P>

<P>There’s classic byplay between Jim and Blair at the remains of the warehouse.  Blair does his nervous chuckle that I really love, Jim is totally resistant to experimentation, but Blair absolutely refuese to give up on him.  And we start to really see how this Sentinel thing is going to work, with Blair pointing out that analysis Jim does at the scene could take days if they send stuff to the lab.</P>

<P>Jim: How good are you at climbing trees?</P>
<P>[Cut to Blair up a tree.]</P>
<P>Blair: Man, I am *not* in the mood to have my skull ventilated by some pissed off magpie.</P>

<P>Then we get Blair’s characteristic babbling to fill the gap while Jim is sniffing the evidence.</P>

<P>Second instance of possessiveness comes in the perfume shop – Blair starts to chat up the girl behind the counter and Jim shoves in front of him and flashes his badge.  You could claim he’s being impatient and wanting to get on with the investigation, but I choose to see it as a very strong statement of &quot;Don’t even think about it – he’s mine!&quot;</P>

<P>I like the realism of the fact that they’ve already been to three shops before they find the right one.</P>

<P>First instance of Blair’s enthusiasm for police work – they identify the suspect and get a location.</P>
<P>Jim: Stay here!</P>
<P>Blair: What, and miss all the action?</P>

<P>Of course, Blair ends up on a bus with a crazed killer and his inexperience leads to a struggle for her gun – just a day in the life of a Sentinel Observor!</P>

<P>On the bus, Blair calls Jim &quot;Ellison&quot;.  It sounds really weird, and I can’t imagine it lasts long.</P>

<P>Jim’s casual use of his senses to locate Carolyn’s watch is really cool, and shows just how much of a difference Blair’s presence is already making on his control.</P>

<P>Nickname number two – when Blair starts talking about his thesis becoming a best seller, Jim calls him Darwin, which is pretty cute.  It’s also an interesting foreshadowing of the show’s finale and a good demonstration of how Blair’s attitude to the whole thing changes between now and then.  Here, he’s really excited about the possibility of publicity; by the end of Season Four, he’s come to realise how dangerous exposing Jim would be and he values their friendship far more than notiriety.</P>

<P>Another nice circle is started by the last line of the first episode being Blair saying that he won’t cut his hair to be a cop, echoed almost word for word in the last line of the last episode when Jim invites him to become his official partner again.</P>

<P>Blair is sooooo cute running after Jim at the end.</P>

<P>All in all, a brilliant set up of the premise and the characters with lots of potential for a really good show based around an interesting and lovable partnership between a &quot;behavioural throw-back to a pre-civilised breed of man&quot; and a &quot;neo-hippy witch-doctor punk&quot;!!</P>
