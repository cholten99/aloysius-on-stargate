</B>
<P>Bizarrely, after Jim’s references to Blair going through the academy at the end of Switchman, and his 180 degree turn to impress upon Blair that they are not partners in Siege, now suddenly Jim is trying to persuade Blair to carry a gun, and Blair is quoting Jim’s insistence that he is &quot;strictly an observor&quot;.  The relationship dynamic is obviously still a little muddled at this early stage.</P>

<P>Jim learns the heavy burden that comes with his sense as he spots the assassin too late to save his friend.  It kind of reminds me of when Superman digs a dead Lois Lane out of the landslide in the movie, but of course Jim’s senses don’t give him the ability to turn back time, so there’s no quick fix here.</P>

<P>There’s an interesting precursor to the scene by the fountain in Sentinel Too here – in this instance, Blair makes Jim come to terms with the fact that Danny’s dead, whereas at the fountain the combined efforts of the paramedics and Simon can’t stop Jim from trying to revive Blair – much to the viewers’ relief!</P>

<P>Beverley is certainly a force to be reckoned with, but I don’t like her much.  Call it irrational hatred of the denial chicks who ruin the slash ideal if you like – but that’s actually not it, since there a fair few female characters in this show who catch the eye of our guys and also gain my affection.  Beverley’s just a bit too abrupt for my liking.</P>

<P>Now the introduction of the loft is definitely not to my liking, and I freely admit the disruption of the slash ideal is the cause this time.  The first time we see what will become the shared abode of our guys, Jim is using it as a venue for a date, and there’s no evidence of Blair whatsoever – another thing I’d forgotten about the opening few episodes; the fact that Blair doesn’t live there yet.  However, Jim opens the scene by talking about Blair to Beverley, a sure sign that his mind is not on the present company but rather on his partner.</P>

<P>More senses info – they’re tied to Jim’s emotions and he can lost control of them by losing them altogether, as well as by them going hyper-sensitive.  This, of course, opens up the idea that being in control of them means he can turn them down as well as up.</P>

<P>I love the way Jim shows Blair’s pass to the cop on reception because Blair isn’t paying attention – it’s part of the whole intimacy thing they slip into right from the start, both looking out for the other and invading each other’s personal space in a relaxed and unconscious way.</P>

<P>Question: How does Blair think Jim could have called him when he lost his hearing?  He wouldn’t have been able to tell when Blair picked up the phone!</P>

<P>Jim automatically turns to Blair for an explanation of Carolyn’s sudden aggression, which is suppose is understandable considering he’s an anthropologist, but it’s still nice to see Jim involving Blair in his life to this extent.</P>

<P>Blair, of course, returns the invitations to be a confidant with an insult:</P>
<P>Blair: You know, for a guy with hyperactive senses, you can be pretty dense.</P>

<P>There’s something about the way Blair’s hair is tied back, or the cute earrings, or the open necked shirt, or a combination of all three, but Blair is really gorgeous in his close-ups in this scene.</P>

<P>Yet another nickname comes into play after Blair gives his explanation of Carolyn’s behaviour, with Jim calling him &quot;Teach&quot; – very cute!</P>

<P>In the courtroom, when the shot cuts to our heroes, Blair is gazing sideways at Jim and, at Beverley’s announcement of Jim’s name, he suddenly seems to snap back to his surroundings and start paying attention again, as if he’s been absorbed with looking at Jim and forgotten where he is for a moment.</P>

<P>I love the way Jim looks over at Blair when the defence attorney asks how he could have seen Juno in the alley, and Blair’s answering despairing headshake is adorable.  And here we have one more limitation of the Sentinel senses – Jim can’t use the evidence he gathers with them without revealing his abilities.  It’s a great way to make him fallible and keep him as a sympathetic character.  All true heroes have to have flaws and face problems or they hold no interest for the ordinary viewer.</P>

<P>Blair acts in true sidekick fashion outside the courhouse, showing his hatred of Jino with a killer glare, but then stopping Jim from attacking him and getting into more trouble.  And, as always, Blair can stop an enraged Jim with only a brief restraining touch and a few words.  Already, his influence over Jim is very strong.</P>

<P>Partners in crime as well as law enforcement – the fact that Jim calls Blair and invites him to be a part of his illegal surveillance of Juno shows how much he trust him already.</P>

<P>Blair may have stopped calling Jim ‘Ellison’ pretty quickly, but he’s still referring to Simon as ‘Banks’ at this point, which sounds just as weird to me.</P>

<P>Solidarity right from the start – when Simon is chewing them both out, Jim’s attempt to protect Blair is immediate and heartfelt:</P>
<P>Jim: It’s my fault, Simon.  Blair had nothing to do with this.</P>
<P>It’s also a rare use of Blair’s first name from Jim.</P>

<P>I love the way Simon’s parting remark demonstrates that his frustration lies in Juno getting the upper hand, and not in real anger at Jim.  Simon’s basically a good guy, and Jim puts him in a very tough position on countless occasions.  He always has to act as a buffer between the Sentinel Secret and the powers that be – a very tricky role.</P>

<P>Teething problems in the partnership are exacerbated by Jim’s irascibility over the Juno problem:</P>
<P>Blair: Which means – it’s probably some Sentinel thing that I don’t understand.</P>
<P>Jim: In other words, we spent half a day trying to figure out what I already know – you don’t have a clue!</P>
<P>Full marks to Blair for neither losing his temper nor backing down.  His expertise in ‘Jim 101’ is already top notch.</P>

<P>Yet another reference that crops up in fanfiction a lot:</P>
<P>Jim: We just took a brief detour to The Sandburg Zone.</P>

<P>Blair get his first taste of Jim’s reckless driving, something with which he will soon be incredibly familiar.</P>

<P>Aiming the gun at the phone and then calling the victim is a very clever hitman trick.</P>

<P>Brilliantly, it’s actually Blair who saves Beverley’s life by breaking down the door and hustling her to the ground.  Jim is once again too late, proving that Blair can be more than adequate back up, even without a gun.  Or course, he then suffers from classic Sidekick Invisibility, since it’s Jim Beverley goes to thank at the hospital.  Showing wonderful character, though, Blair still has the grace to offer up an adorable silent apology for Jim’s rudeness before acting once again in true sidekick fashion and following the hero wherever he leads.</P>

<P>Please note – this interpretation of Blair’s role is in no way meant to diminish his importance to the partnership.  As all great assistants are, it’s clear he’s actually firmly in control the whole time and, even though he may appear to be the submissive tagalong to the outside world, I’ve already demonstrated that he is by far the dominant one and has Jim totally at his mercy!</P>

<P>Carolyn’s rather sweet when she apologises for her over-reaction regarding Beverley.  I really like the dynamic between Carolyn and Jim – it’s very realistically portrayed.</P>

<P>When Jim, Blair, Carolyn and Simon discuss the twin thing, Blair contributes, but he only looks at Jim.  It could be seen as him still feeling like an outsider at the PD and taking solace in focusing on Jim’s familiar presence, but Blair’s academic background and innate confidence don’t bear that out, so we’re left with – he just likes looking at Jim, which has already been suggested by the courtroom scene!</P>

<P>Blair just keeps on trying to help Jim with his senses, even when Jim’s actively dismissing him – determination, or what?</P>

<P>I love Simon’s reaction when Jim tells Juno his brother isn’t really dead.  You can just see him thinking, &quot;Oh, great!  What the hell is he doing *now*?&quot;</P>

<P>I’m pretty sure the tape recorder thing was Blair’s idea – it’s got the Sandburg ‘weird and risky but might just work’ vibe all over it!</P>

<P>Blair’s fascination with and obvious admiration for Jim’s regained control over his senses is very cute.  He also identifies and plays up to his perceived role – a true observor and commentator on events – very cool:</P>
<P>Blair: Well, knowing that the faithful companion’s most important job is knowing when to get lost, I’ll see you later, man.&quot;</P>

<P>Once again, Beverley thanks only Jim for saving her life, and Jim’s response to a possible renewed come-on is once again to talk about Blair!  So he ends up with another female friend, leaving him free to focus all his attention where it should be – on Blair!</P>

<P>Another good story, with more great teamwork of a kind only Jim and Blair can achieve.</P>
