<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
had been two days since SG-1 had returned home with successful
reports of the rescue of the Abydonians.  Of course, that victory had
been greatly overshadowed by the tragic death of Sha&rsquo;re, and
General Hammond wondered how that event was going to affect the
future of his flagship team.  The whole base seemed subdued as the
news of their archaeologist&rsquo;s loss spread.  It was incredible
how many people had wanted to pass their condolences on to Daniel
Jackson, and only the careful mother-henning of Colonel O&rsquo;Neill
had prevented the young man from being mobbed by well-wishers as he
lay in the infirmary.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hammond
winced as he looked over Daniel&rsquo;s matter-of-fact account of
what had happened on the mission.  Doctor Fraiser had released him
from the infirmary that morning, allowing him to go to Abydos for
Sha&rsquo;re&rsquo;s funeral, and the report had been on Hammond&rsquo;s
desk within an hour of his return.  The typed pages represented the
conclusion of a search that had been driving the young man
relentlessly for the past two and a half years; paragraphs of
carefully impersonal text that told nothing of the anguish and
heartache that must be behind them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking
back to his first meeting with Daniel, Hammond remembered how
irritated he had been by the archaeologist&rsquo;s single-minded
insistence that he be a part of the rescue mission.  In the middle of
a crisis, he had returned to Earth demanding privileges and
dispensation he had not earned, instantly putting Hammond&rsquo;s
back up.  It had not been a good first impression, but Hammond had
quickly come to realise that the situation had not brought out the
best in Daniel.  In the ensuing months and years, that same passion
and determination had served the SGC on countless occasions, leading
to the protection of the planet from alien threat, and Daniel had
found a place in Hammond&rsquo;s affections, as he had in those of
the majority of the personnel.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now,
things were uncertain.  Hammond knew Daniel&rsquo;s presence at the
SGC had initially been solely due to the search for his wife; would
the end of that task herald the end of his time there?  Hammond
certainly hoped not, and in fact believed that Daniel would turn his
desire to save Sha&rsquo;re outward to encompass all the humans that
were at risk from the Goa&rsquo;uld.  He had demonstrated selfless
altruism many times and Hammond did not think he would turn his back
on the Stargate project just because his own personal quest was over.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But
grief was unpredictable.  Hammond knew only too well what it was like
to lose a wife, but he could not imagine how the death of Sha&rsquo;re
by Teal&rsquo;c&rsquo;s hand after so long an enforced separation
would affect the young man he had come to look upon with such
fatherly regard.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
knock at the open door of his office brought Hammond out of his inner
musings, and he looked up to see their subject standing just outside.
 Daniel looked tired and worn down; there seemed to be something
missing from his persona and Hammond's heart constricted painfully
when he realised it was hope.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">General,
do you have a moment?&rdquo;  The tone was weary.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Of
course.  Come on in, son,&rdquo; he replied warmly.  &ldquo;Take a
seat.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
entered the room slowly and sat down on the other side of the desk. 
There was still a faint red mark across his forehead, but Hammond had
received Dr Frasier&rsquo;s assurances that there was no lasting
damage from the burn.  He waited patiently for Daniel to say what was
on his mind, not wanting to pressure him in any way, though inwardly
he feared he was about to receive the young man&rsquo;s resignation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
Daniel spoke, it was with the same quiet lack of emotion that had
permeated his mission report, which worried Hammond more than if he
had been faced with open grief.  He knew Daniel felt things very
deeply, even though he seldom showed it, and he hoped that this
apparent calm was not the sign of dangerous emotional suppression.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I&rsquo;d
like to request some time off, if I may.&rdquo;  The statement was
not as final as Hammond had feared and he gladly acquiesced.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Absolutely.
 Take as much time as you need.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
elicited an almost smile and a soft, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Do
you have any specific plans?&rdquo; Hammond wanted to know.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Actually,
yes,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the other thing I
wanted to talk to you about.  I have a friend in Cascade, Washington
&ndash; an anthropologist &ndash; and I&rsquo;d like to approach him
with a view to recruiting him for the SGC.  I think he&rsquo;d be a
valuable addition to the project; he has far greater anthropological
expertise than I do and I believe it would be beneficial for us to
expand our personnel in that direction.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">You
realise he would have to be fully vetted before he could be given
security clearance, and that he couldn&rsquo;t be told about the
Stargate until he&rsquo;d agreed to take the position?&rdquo; 
Hammond was intrigued by Daniel&rsquo;s request, but couldn&rsquo;t
help wondering if bringing another civilian into the SGC was a good
idea.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Of
course.  This trip would simply be to ascertain if he&rsquo;d be
willing to make the move to Colorado.  He&rsquo;s just finishing up
on his doctoral thesis at the moment, so he&rsquo;ll be looking for a
permanent position soon, but I don&rsquo;t know how strong his ties
to Cascade are.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hammond
decided that any recommendation of Daniel&rsquo;s was worth
investigating.  &ldquo;By all means, find out,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;We
can deal with all the red tape if and when it becomes necessary.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Thank
you,&rdquo; Daniel said again, then rose to his feet.  &ldquo;With
your permission, I&rsquo;ll make my travel arrangements.  I&rsquo;d
like to leave today, if that&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hammond
readily agreed, sensing Daniel&rsquo;s need to get away from the SGC
for a while.  He only hoped this friend would be able to offer some
comfort to the bereaved young man.  Perhaps, despite the secrecy of
the events surrounding Sha&rsquo;re&rsquo;s death, someone completely
unconnected to the Stargate project would be exactly the right person
to help.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>***</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
strolled down the corridor towards Daniel&rsquo;s office.  He&rsquo;d
lost track of the other man after they&rsquo;d got back from Abydos
but, knowing Daniel as he did, his office was Jack&rsquo;s best bet. 
Even taking into account the events of the past few days, he expected
to find Daniel back at work on some alien text or other.  It was with
surprise then, that he arrived in the doorway to find Daniel
apparently packing.  He stopped dead, an icy finger of fear piercing
his heart at the thought that Daniel might be leaving for good. 
Common sense reasserted itself a moment later, though, as he noticed
it was only an overnight bag Daniel was packing, and that the
majority of the younger man&rsquo;s possessions remained in place.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
looked up at his entrance.  &ldquo;Hey, Jack,&rdquo; he said
casually.  &ldquo;Hang on a moment, will you?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
was then that Jack realised Daniel was also in the process of making
a phone call, the unit on loud speaker as he continued to gather
items to put in the bag.  The sound of ringing was interrupted by a
sleepy male voice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;&rsquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Lo?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Hey,
Hairball &ndash; you awake?&rdquo;  Daniel&rsquo;s jovial call from
the other side of the room took Jack rather by surprise, and
evidently whoever was on the other end of the line too, since there
was a moment&rsquo;s silence.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the voice spoke up again, sounding more alert.  &ldquo;Wacko?  Is
that you?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
raised an eyebrow at that, but Daniel ignored him.  Jack&rsquo;s
curiosity was at fever pitch by now; who could Daniel be calling, who
knew him well enough to get away with such a bizarre nickname?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Yeah,
it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Daniel was saying.  &ldquo;Look, I know this is
a bit short notice, but I&rsquo;m heading up to Cascade for a few
days.  Have you got some free time?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I&rsquo;m
all yours,&rdquo; came the response, then the voice took on a
concerned note.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;  This confirmed
Jack&rsquo;s deduction that the owner of the voice was very familiar
with his archaeologist; you had to know Daniel inside out to be able
to tell he was hurting over the phone.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
had sobered at the question and, when he spoke again, Jack ached at
the simple desolation in his words.  &ldquo;Sha&rsquo;re&rsquo;s
dead, Blair.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
voice &ndash; Blair, Jack now surmised, though he&rsquo;d never heard
Daniel mention the name before &ndash; immediately offered sincere
condolences.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Oh,
Daniel.  I&rsquo;m so sorry.  What time do you land?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">About
six, your time,&rdquo; Daniel informed Blair, quickly wrestling his
emotions back under control.  &ldquo;Can you meet me at the airport?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Sure,
man.  Six o&rsquo;clock.  I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Thanks,
Blair.  I&rsquo;ll see you then.&rdquo;  With that, Daniel reached
over to cut the connection, then turned his attention back to his
packing.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
waited a moment, then asked, &ldquo;Uh, Wacko?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">College
nickname,&rdquo; Daniel grimaced.  He seemed relieved that Jack had
kept the topic light, and Jack was glad he&rsquo;d read the situation
correctly.  &ldquo;I developed my theories of cross-pollination when
I was studying at Rainier and the other students used to call me
Wacko Jacko.&rdquo;  He glanced over at Jack and offered up a shy
smile.  &ldquo;So I guess Spacemonkey is somewhat of an improvement. 
Anyway, Blair&rsquo;s the only person who still calls me Wacko, and
he doesn&rsquo;t mean anything by it, so I don&rsquo;t really mind.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">And
Blair is?&rdquo;  Jack was by now very intrigued by the mysterious
man in Cascade, a friend of Daniel&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d never heard of
before.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Blair
Sandburg,&rdquo; Daniel revealed, and Jack filed the name away in his
mind for future reference.  &ldquo;We studied Archaeology and
Anthropology together at Rainier.  I was on my second degree and
Blair was on his first; then I went off to Chicago to pursue Arc,
while he stuck with Anth in Cascade.  We&rsquo;ve kept in touch off
and on over the years, and he&rsquo;s a good friend.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack&rsquo;s
military side wanted to know just how much this Blair knew about
Sha&rsquo;re, but he squashed it, sure that Daniel would not have
compromised the SGC.  Instead, he focused on Daniel&rsquo;s immediate
plans.  &ldquo;How long are you going to be gone?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I&rsquo;m
not sure yet.  General Hammond has given me as long as I want, but I
don&rsquo;t think it will be more than a few days &ndash; a week at
the most.&rdquo;  Daniel fixed Jack with an earnest stare.  &ldquo;I
just want to get away from here for a while, spend some time with
someone who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the Goa&rsquo;uld, or
the Stargate, or&hellip; anything.  Can you understand that, Jack?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Sure,

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
closed his now packed bag and headed for the door.  He stopped just
in front of Jack and the mixture of pain and gratitude in his eyes
made Jack want to take him in his arms.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Thanks,

see you in a few days.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
then he was gone, leaving Jack alone in the empty office.  Jack was

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the loft in Cascade, Blair was checking his emails, whole Jim sat on
the couch reading.  Blair hadn&rsquo;t yet mentioned the phone call
from Daniel, but would have to soon if he was going to get to the

 Blair suddenly had to swallow past the incredible dryness in his
mouth.  He couldn&rsquo;t figure out why he was so nervous.  He
hadn&rsquo;t done anything wrong and he wasn&rsquo;t *going* to do
anything wrong, but his stomach was doing backflips at the prospect
of the conversation he was about to have.  Recent events had left his
relationship with Jim slightly off-kilter and his usual ability to

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
grimaced, remembering the pain in Daniel&rsquo;s voice when they&rsquo;d
spoken on the phone.  &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; he stated sadly.  &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know if I told you before, but his wife disappeared
nearly three years ago.  He&rsquo;s been looking for her ever since,
and he&rsquo;s just found out that she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Poor
guy.&rdquo;  The sympathy in Jim&rsquo;s tone was sincere, and Blair
felt a surge of affection for him, glad that Jim could so readily
feel for a complete stranger.  &ldquo;Is he coming to stay here with
us?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
nervousness came back with a vengeance at this question, and Blair
prayed he wasn&rsquo;t giving it away; though with Jim being a
Sentinel, it was rather a hopeless prayer.  &ldquo;Uh, no,&rdquo; he
said.  &ldquo;You see, Daniel's never been very good at opening up,
and I thought he might feel more comfortable if he only has to see
me, so I&rsquo;m going to suggest he books into a hotel.  I&rsquo;m
heading over to pick him up at the airport now.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If
Jim noticed the tension in Blair&rsquo;s voice, he didn&rsquo;t show
it, merely saying, &ldquo;Okay, that makes sense.  I&rsquo;m sure the
last thing he needs right now is to play house-guest to a total
stranger.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Again,
Jim&rsquo;s understanding warmed Blair, and gave him the confidence
to reveal the last piece of information.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
Daniel to feel as if he&rsquo;s keeping me from anything, so I, uh,
thought I&rsquo;d stay with him at the hotel tonight.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">No

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
total lack of reaction in Jim&rsquo;s response took Blair by
surprise, and he blurted out, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim
seemed suddenly to come alert at this, though there was still no
suspicion in his body language.  &ldquo;Why would I mind?&rdquo; 
Then his eyes narrowed slightly as an idea came to him.  &ldquo;When
you were at college together, you and Daniel weren&rsquo;t, uh&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
pounced on the implication like a cat with a piece of string.  &ldquo;Would
it matter?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
he felt like a complete heel as Jim looked hurt.  &ldquo;Of course
not.  I trust you, Chief.  I was just interested to know.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Sorry,

 Daniel&rsquo;s not my type.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
elicited a raised eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh, really?  Why not?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
ventured a sly grin, the tension of the moment before now completely
gone, leaving only a faint stab of guilt at his unfairness to Jim. 
&ldquo;Well, see, he&rsquo;s a science nerd, and he&rsquo;s kinda
skinny, with long hair and glasses&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now
it was Jim&rsquo;s turn to smile, as he teased back, &ldquo;Aha!  Now
I understand!  You&rsquo;re not secreting this guy in a hotel so you
can have your wicked way with him without me knowing &ndash; you&rsquo;re
really just trying to keep him away from me because you can&rsquo;t
handle the competition!&rdquo;  Then he sobered again and said
simply, &ldquo;Go.  Be there for your friend.  He&rsquo;s lucky to
have someone like you to turn to when he&rsquo;s hurting.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
rose from his seat at the table and crossed over to Jim, leaning down
to give him a heartfelt kiss.  &ldquo;Thanks, Jim.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>***</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
he drove to the airport, Blair thought back over his friendship with
Daniel Jackson.  They had stayed in close contact after Daniel had
left Rainier for the Oriental Institute in Chicago.  The last time
they had actually seen each other, though, had been almost four years
ago, a few days before Daniel was due to give a lecture about his
theories of cross-pollination.  Blair remembered his friend had been
very nervous about the lecture, saying that it had the potential to
either make or break his career.  Blair had wished him the best of
luck and then &ndash; Daniel had disappeared as if from the face of
the Earth.  Blair had tried calling him to find out how the lecture
had gone, but had been unable to reach him, even though he had tried
all the places and people he could think of.  At that point, Jim had
entered his life, and the mystery of Daniel&rsquo;s whereabouts had
been shunted to the back of Blair&rsquo;s mind, under the assumption
that the other man had taken an impulsive trip abroad, which wasn&rsquo;t
entirely out of character.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
just over a year later, Daniel had called Blair out of the blue to
tell him he was back in the US, had been married for a year but his
wife had been kidnapped and he was now devoting his time to searching
for her, while at the same time taking on a consultancy position with
the military.  Blair had been stunned; it was too much bizarre
information to take in all at once, but he was glad to be back in
touch with his friend again, despite the sad circumstances.  They had
both been too busy with their jobs to meet up, but had exchanged
sporadic emails and phone calls since, although their previous
closeness had been hindered by the secrets they now had to keep from
one another.  Blair had told Daniel about his job at the Cascade PD,
but not divulged the real reason for it, and it seemed Daniel was
unable to share any of the details of his own job, or the actual
circumstances surrounding his wife&rsquo;s disappearance.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now,
suddenly, Daniel was arriving in Cascade, and Blair found himself
looking forward to having a real conversation with his friend after
so long.  Obviously, he wished Daniel&rsquo;s news had been better
but still, it was nice to think that Daniel valued his friendship
enough to call upon Blair in his time of need.  It would also be a
welcome break from dwelling on his own recent failures and uncertain
future.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
almost missed Daniel entirely at the airport.  He was waiting at the
gate where Daniel&rsquo;s flight was due to arrive and scanning the
crowd for his friend, without success.  As the people gradually
thinned out, Blair heard a familiar voice calling his name, and he
turned to see a very unexpected sight.  Daniel was walking towards
him, bag in hand, but it wasn&rsquo;t a Daniel Blair recognised in
the least.  The man before him sported short brown hair, no glasses,
and a physique that spoke of regular visits to the gym, the whole
package encased in stylish, expensive clothes.  He couldn&rsquo;t
have been more different to the Daniel Blair remembered from their
college days.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
stopped just in front of him and smiled past the lines of sorrow that
marred his handsome features.  &ldquo;Damn, it&rsquo;s good to see
you, Blair,&rdquo; he said emphatically.  &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
changed a bit.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
managed to swallow his surprise and find his voice.  &ldquo;The same
can definitely *not* be said about you, man.  Jim&rsquo;s going to
kill me!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel&rsquo;s
brow furrowed in confusion.  &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Because
I told him you were a skinny, long-haired, bespectacled geek, and
therefore not my type!&rdquo; Blair explained, then suddenly realised
how his words had sounded, and wondered if he&rsquo;d put his foot in
it already.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
was relieved when Daniel actually burst out laughing, although it was
an odd, choked sort of laughter, as if Daniel&rsquo;s larynx was out
of practice producing it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I
knew coming to see you was the right thing to do,&rdquo; Daniel said
warmly when he&rsquo;d recovered his composure, and Blair smiled back
at him, pleased by the compliment.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Do
we need to head to baggage claim?&rdquo; Blair asked, but Daniel
shook his head.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I
packed light,&rdquo; he said, indicating the holdall in his hand, &ldquo;so
we&rsquo;re free to go.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
led Daniel out to the parking lot and over to his green Volvo, which
luckily was behaving itself that day.  As he pulled out onto the
freeway, he said directly, &ldquo;I figured right now probably
wouldn&rsquo;t be the best time for you to meet Jim, so the next
question is &ndash; how much do you want to spend on a hotel?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
leaned his head against the back of the passenger seat and closed his
eyes with evident relief.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a genius,&rdquo; he
said.  &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything, but I&rsquo;m
really not up to being sociable at the moment.  As to price, I&rsquo;ve
been earning a ridiculous salary for the past two and a half years
and not spending any of it, so I think I&rsquo;ll indulge myself for
once and say money is no object.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
grinned at that and mentally altered the plan he&rsquo;d been
formulating.  He drove to Cascade&rsquo;s best hotel and asked for
one of their suites, amazed when Daniel simply handed over a credit
card without even blinking at the price.  Working for the military as
whatever kind of consultant Daniel was must be quite lucrative.  When
they reached the luxurious room, Daniel simply dumped his bag on the
floor, kicked off his shoes and collapsed onto the couch with a sigh.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">You

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">That
bad, huh?&rdquo;  Blair was even more curious about all the things
Daniel couldn&rsquo;t tell him than usual, but he knew this was not
the time to fish for clues.  He would be there for Daniel in whatever
way was needed, but he had enough experience of his friend to
recognise that asking for information would only push the other man
away.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
only grimaced in response to his question, which told Blair he wasn&rsquo;t
yet ready to talk, so Blair quickly deflected the subject to
something else.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">You
hungry yet?  I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;ve got a great restaurant
here, or we can get something brought up.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Room
service sounds great,&rdquo; Daniel decided with a tired smile that
showed how much he appreciated Blair&rsquo;s tacit support.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
spent some time perusing the menu and then talked about nothing while
they ate.  It was when the plates had been cleared away and they were
just starting on the second bottle of wine that Blair decided it was
time to strike.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
leaned back in the armchair he&rsquo;d selected and fixed Daniel with
an earnest stare.  &ldquo;I know a lot of it&rsquo;s classified and
all that, but what can you tell me about it?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
seemed neither surprised by the question nor confused by the oblique
reference.  He merely set down his wine glass with infinite care,
took a deep breath and began in a soft tone.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">We

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Oh,
god.  Daniel &ndash; that&rsquo;s awful.&rdquo;  Blair didn&rsquo;t
know what else to say.  He couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it must have
been like for Daniel to find his wife after so long, only to lose her
again irrevocably, and in such terrible circumstances.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
continued, focusing somewhere over Blair&rsquo;s shoulder, his eyes
haunted as if he was picturing what had happened.  &ldquo;Everyone
keeps offering me their sympathy, but Sha&rsquo;re&rsquo;s the one
who deserves it, not me.  All this time I&rsquo;ve had support from
my friends and colleagues, but she was all alone.  I can&rsquo;t
imagine the strength it must have taken to survive what she suffered,
but she was still fighting, right to the end.  She &ndash; &ldquo; 
Daniel paused and cleared his throat as if he was having difficulty
saying the words.  &ldquo;She had a baby last year and, just before
she died, she made me promise to find him.&rdquo;  Daniel&rsquo;s
voice grew determined.  &ldquo;And I will &ndash; no matter what it
takes.  I&rsquo;ll find him and I&rsquo;ll make sure he knows what an
amazing woman his mother was, and how much she loved him.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now
Daniel turned his gaze on Blair, and Blair could see the unshed tears
shining in his eyes.  &ldquo;I failed her so badly, Blair.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I

did everything you could for her.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If
anything, the despair in Daniel&rsquo;s face intensified, and the

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">No,

hopeless, every day the hope I had of ever finding her got less and
less, and every day she seemed further and further away from me.&rdquo;
 He broke off and looked down at his hands, which were clasped in

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">What

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
was another brief pause, then Daniel said so quietly that Blair had
to strain to make out the words, &ldquo;I fell in love with someone
else.&rdquo;  He looked up again.  &ldquo;I fell in love with Jack.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
looked into Daniel&rsquo;s stricken face, and wondered which gods the
other man had pissed off so royally that they&rsquo;d rewarded him
with such an unending list of woes.  He&rsquo;d been wondering for
some time if Daniel was ever going to have the chance to start again
with someone new, having long ago come to the conclusion that the
chances of him finding Sha&rsquo;re were slim at best.  Now, it
seemed Daniel had found someone else but, if Blair knew anything
about him, guilt would destroy any hope of a relationship at this
point.  He tried to think of something &ndash; anything &ndash; that
might make Daniel feel better.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">How

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I

how I felt a few months ago but I think the feelings have been there
a lot longer &ndash; years, maybe.  It&rsquo;s possible they actually
predate me even meeting Sha&rsquo;re.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">And

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">No!&rdquo;
 Daniel was adamant on that point.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never wavered

your life to Sha&rsquo;re, but that&rsquo;s over now.  There&rsquo;s
no reason for you to ruin your future out of some misguided respect

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
managed a bittersweet smile.  &ldquo;If she were here now, she&rsquo;d
probably hit me over the head with something heavy and tell me to

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
smiled back, glad to see that Daniel could look past his grief and

an important step.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Oh,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
talked long into the night, Daniel relating tales of the year he
spent with Sha&rsquo;re, but always leaving out the tantalising
details of location and background.  Eventually, they both succumbed
to fatigue and went to their rooms, Blair feeling as if he had at
least helped his friend a little.  Daniel had a long way to go before
he would get over Sha&rsquo;re&rsquo;s death, if he ever did, but,
with Blair&rsquo;s guidance, he had set his foot upon the path that
night.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
next morning, both men slept late, and met again over breakfast in
the main part of the suite.  Blair thought Daniel looked a little
less drawn, and decided the trip to Cascade was already doing him
good.  He certainly tucked into his meal with enthusiasm, which was
an encouraging sign.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
they&rsquo;d demolished all the food, Daniel glanced at his watch and
started guiltily.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keeping you from anything, am
I?&rdquo; he asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
shook his head.  &ldquo;Nope.  I haven&rsquo;t got anything to do
today.  In fact, I haven&rsquo;t got anything to do for the
foreseeable future, so I&rsquo;m all yours as long as you want to
stay.&rdquo;  He went for cheerful, but thought he might have missed
it by several levels, an opinion that was confirmed when Daniel
looked at him sharply.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">What
about your dissertation and your work at the PD?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
should have known Daniel would pick up on that, and he cursed his
insensitivity at saying more than he should.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Forget
it, man,&rdquo; he said, trying to backpedal his way out of the

problems.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But
Daniel wouldn&rsquo;t be deterred now that he knew something was
wrong.  &ldquo;No, Blair, tell me, &ldquo; he insisted.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
going on?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
so Blair told Daniel the tale &ndash; or rather an edited version of
the tale, much like Daniel&rsquo;s own talk of Sha&rsquo;re the night
before &ndash; of his dissertation; how Naomi had unwittingly brought
it to the attention of the press and how he had denounced it as a
fraud, getting himself drummed out of academia in the process.  Even
a month after the event, it was still difficult for Blair to talk
about the press conference, and the fact that Daniel was such a close
and trusted friend only made it harder.  He hated giving the
impression that he had made a mockery of all his hard work by
fabricating research.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
he came to the end of his story, Blair waited with apprehension while
Daniel sat and stared at him for a long moment.  He needn&rsquo;t
have worried, though, as the other man gave him a slow smile.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">So,
you finally found your Sentinel,&rdquo; he said with satisfaction, as

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
felt his mouth drop open and heard spluttering noises coming from it
as his brain windmilled madly.  Daniel just laughed.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Oh,
come on!  You don&rsquo;t honestly expect me to believe that you&rsquo;d
write a fraudulent thesis, do you?&rdquo;  He grinned over at Blair,
a teasing note in his voice.  &ldquo;Putting Jim&rsquo;s name all
over it, and not considering what would happen when it was published
&ndash; that I can believe, but presenting false research?  No way!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
still couldn&rsquo;t find his voice, but it seemed Daniel didn&rsquo;t
need confirmation to continue his thought processes.  &ldquo;Drummed
out of academia for wild theories &ndash; I know how that feels. 
But, wow &ndash; you actually found a real, live Sentinel.  That must
be pretty exciting, huh?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">You
have no idea,&rdquo; Blair enthused, finally forcing his brain out of
its panicked numbness.  &ldquo;It kinda blows that I can&rsquo;t get
my doctorate any more, but Jim&rsquo;s worth it, without a doubt.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">But
what are you going to do now?&rdquo; Daniel wanted to know,
unknowingly hitting upon the question that had been plaguing Blair
for weeks.  &ldquo;I always imagined you taking up a teaching
position at Rainier when you finally finished your thesis, but I
guess that&rsquo;s not possible now.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
sighed.  &ldquo;Jim and Simon suggested I become a cop so I can work
with Jim full time, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s really
what I want.  I mean, I know that&rsquo;s pretty much what I&rsquo;ve
been doing the last four years anyway, but it&rsquo;s one thing to
tag along as an observer; it&rsquo;s totally something else to put on
a badge and do it for real.  Besides, anthropology has been my life
for as long as I can remember, and I don't want to give it up for
good.  Guess I don&rsquo;t have much of a choice, though.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Maybe
you do,&rdquo; Daniel said unexpectedly, &ldquo;which brings me
rather neatly to the other reason I came here to see you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
was confused.  &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Well,&rdquo;
Daniel replied, the smile back in full force, &ldquo;how would you
feel about coming to work with me in Colorado?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>***</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first Jim knew of Blair&rsquo;s return to the loft was when the Volvo
drew up outside the apartment building.  His senses had become
attuned to his Guide and lover over the years they had known one
another so that now, even when he had them all at normal settings, he
was immediately alerted to Blair&rsquo;s presence nearby.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
focused his hearing on the lobby downstairs and discovered that Blair
was not alone.  There was another man with him, a man Jim assumed
must be Daniel Jackson, the friend Blair had told him about the day
before.  Jim thought back on the conversation, remembering how Blair
had been unsure of his reaction, and feeling a little sad that Blair
should be uncertain of their bond.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
realised that the events of the past six months had damaged their
relationship and it would be up to Jim, as the main transgressor, to
reassure Blair that he was loved and trusted.  As far as Jim was
concerned, if Blair could stick with him after the Alex Incident and
the Press Conference, he had more than earned the right to be
trusted.  Jim was still in awe of the fact that Blair had given up
all his dreams to protect the secret of his abilities, ruining all
chance of obtaining his doctorate and losing the respect of his
academic peers in the process.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His
thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Blair and his companion
outside the door.  It opened and Blair bounced in, looking happier
than Jim had seen him in quite a while.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Hey,
man!&rdquo; he said brightly in greeting, then stepped aside to allow
his companion entrance.  &ldquo;This is Daniel Jackson, my old
college friend.  Daniel, this is Jim.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
man who entered the loft behind Blair was not what Jim had expected
from Blair&rsquo;s description.  Jim raised a surprised eyebrow in
Blair&rsquo;s direction, but Blair merely shrugged with an innocent
grin on his face.  It was Daniel who responded to the silent byplay
by stepping forward and extending his hand, his expression amused.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">In
Blair&rsquo;s defence,&rdquo; he said as Jim shook his hand in a firm
handshake, &ldquo;I have changed quite a lot since last Blair and I
saw each other.  The military tends to have that effect on people.&rdquo;
 The tone was light, but Jim sensed the underlying sorrow behind the
words.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to meet you, Jim.  I&rsquo;ve heard a
great deal about you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Likewise,&rdquo;
Jim replied with an answering smile of his own, &ldquo;though some of
it not entirely accurate, it seems.  Welcome to Cascade.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Throughout
the introductions, Blair had been practically vibrating with nervous
excitement, and Jim wondered what exactly was going on.  Evidently,
Blair had some news, and it seemed likely that it was something to do
with Daniel.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
once again, it was Daniel who moved the conversation in the direction
of Jim&rsquo;s thoughts.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, then looked
down at the floor in a self-deprecating gesture that told Jim a lot
about his character, &ldquo;you may not be so welcoming when Blair
stops bouncing and tells you why we&rsquo;re both here.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Coffee!&rdquo;
Blair interjected before he could carry on.  &ldquo;We need coffee. 
I&rsquo;ll make some.&rdquo;  He bustled over to the kitchen and
started banging mugs about, leaving Jim and Daniel still standing in
front of the door.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim
managed an awkward smile, though he was beginning to get slightly
worried by Blair&rsquo;s behaviour.  He gestured to the couch and
Daniel preceded him into the living room area to sit down.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">How
long are you going to be in Cascade, Mr Jackson?&rdquo; Jim asked,
inwardly wincing at the inane question.  Small talk had never been
his strong point.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Please
call me Daniel,&rdquo; the other man replied.  &ldquo;There are far
too few people who do.  And how long I stay really depends on your
response to why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Oh?&rdquo;
 Jim&rsquo;s curiosity rose another notch.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Blair
has told me all about Naomi&rsquo;s mistake with his thesis, and what
happened afterwards.  I swear, I have never met anyone who can create
disasters quite like Naomi, especially when she&rsquo;s trying to do
the right thing.&rdquo;  Daniel grimaced slightly, suggesting to Jim
that he&rsquo;d had more than one chaotic run-in with Blair's mother
in the past.  He was about to agree with Daniel&rsquo;s assessment of
her, when the other man continued, putting all thought of Naomi
straight out of Jim&rsquo;s mind.  &ldquo;It must be hard for you to
hide your Sentinel abilities in your line of work.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim
started in shock, and whipped round to find Blair standing just
behind the couch.  Before he could voice an accusation, Blair
forestalled him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Believe
me,&rdquo; Daniel said soothingly, further preventing Jim from
speaking.  &ldquo;I have no intention of exposing you.  In fact, I
have a proposition for you that would enable you to act as a Sentinel
in service of your country, without risk of discovery.  But I&rsquo;m
getting ahead of myself.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
Daniel collected his thoughts, Blair came round the couch and sat
down next to Jim, his earlier obsession with coffee apparently
forgotten.  Jim could feel the tension in the younger man&rsquo;s
body as he waited for their visitor to continue.  Eventually, Daniel
fixed him with an intense stare, took a deep breath and began again.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim

looking to recruit for the project.  My department is crying out for
people with Blair&rsquo;s expertise, and someone with Sentinel
abilities would be an invaluable addition to the military side of
things.  Now, I know Blair&rsquo;s in an awkward position as far as
employment prospects go so, basically, I&rsquo;m offering you both a
job where your skills will be put to good use and you will be
contributing to the security of the country.  I won&rsquo;t mislead
you; it&rsquo;s not an easy job, and there&rsquo;s a fair amount of
danger involved, but you&rsquo;ll experience things you can&rsquo;t
even imagine and you&rsquo;ll be a part of something extremely
important.  I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t tell you any more; you&rsquo;ll
have to come to Colorado and meet General Hammond if you want more
information.  Anyway,&rdquo; Daniel rose, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ve got a lot to talk about, and I&rsquo;d only be in the
way, so I&rsquo;ll leave you to discuss things.  You know where I am
when you reach a decision, Blair.  There&rsquo;s no time limit on

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silence

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
was what Jim had been most worried about, and he wasn&rsquo;t
surprised that Blair hadn&rsquo;t grasped the intricacies of the
situation.  &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m curious,&rdquo; he said
gently, &ldquo;but you have to realise something about the military,
Chief.  They&rsquo;re not going to tell you all their secrets and
then just let you walk away.  If this project is so secret and so
important, you won&rsquo;t find out what it&rsquo;s all about until
you&rsquo;re so far embroiled in it that you can&rsquo;t get out. 
Believe me, I&rsquo;ve had experience with this kind of thing &ndash;
they&rsquo;ll make sure they own you before they&rsquo;ll tell you
anything.  I have to admit I hadn&rsquo;t ever planned to get back
into the military, and I&rsquo;m not wild about the thought of you
getting involved either.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair&rsquo;s

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
relaxed an iota.  &ldquo;No argument there, man.  Don&rsquo;t worry,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

Blair said earnestly, and Jim once more marvelled at how selfless his
lover was.  He could tell Daniel&rsquo;s offer had Blair really
excited, but he knew without a doubt that Blair would not pursue it
if Jim didn&rsquo;t want him to do so.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Two
months later, Jim found himself in a locker room deep underground,
preparing for the most bizarre mission he&rsquo;d ever been assigned.
 As he thought back over the past few weeks, he decided he should
have realised this outcome had been inevitable from the moment Daniel
Jackson had got off the plane in Cascade.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim
hadn&rsquo;t seen Blair so excited about anything since the day he&rsquo;d
walked into the young anthropologist&rsquo;s office to get help with
his senses.  If he was honest with himself, Jim would have to admit
he was pretty excited too; he&rsquo;d always known his association
with Blair would take him in new and interesting directions, but he
never would have imagined anything like the SGC.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
had accepted the existence of the Stargate and all its ramifications
as if it was the most natural thing in the world; in fact, he had
told Jim later that his immediate reaction had been delight that
Daniel&rsquo;s theories had been proved correct.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
similarities between the two scientists were marked; both had had
unorthodox childhoods that involved a lot of travelling, both had
achieved high academic standards in similar fields of study, both had
subsequently been cast out of the academic community because they
were unable to reveal the truth of their strange theories, both had
died and been brought back to life, both were incredibly passionate
about what they did, and both had a tendency to talk at high speed
and stutter when they were nervous or excited.  Watching then enthuse
together about some alien text or other was at once exhausting and
heartwarming, and it was Blair&rsquo;s interaction with Daniel that
told Jim the move to Colorado had been the right decision.  The
debacle over the dissertation had cost Blair not only his job and his
dreams, but also most of his academic acquaintances, who had turned
away from him when he had claimed his thesis was fraudulent.  Now he
had new and exciting opportunities to put his anthropological skills
to use, and he had also found a kindred spirit from whom he need have
no secrets.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
for Jim, it had taken him a while longer to get over the shock of the
Stargate, but he now saw the project for the important endeavour it
was, and he was looking forward to extending his &lsquo;tribe&rsquo;
to include the entire planet.  He had found it surprisingly easy to
slot back into the military and the prospect of being able to use his
senses openly had proved to be a profound relief.  He had also
discovered two good friends in Jack O&rsquo;Neill and the Jaffa,
Teal&rsquo;c, both of whom had welcomed him as a fellow brother in
arms.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All
in all, Jim thought, it had been a remarkably good fit for both
himself and Blair.  The biggest test was yet to come, however, as
they geared up for their very first mission through the Stargate. 
Much to his surprise and gratification, Jim, newly reinstated with
the rank of Captain, had been given command of his own unit,
designated SG-19.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
had yet to meet the other two members of his team, as this first
mission would be a training run for himself and Blair, with Jack and
Daniel accompanying them to show them the ropes.  After that, SG-19
would get their own mission roster and Jim would lead them through
the Stargate on a regular basis.  The prospect was more than a little
exhilarating.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
sound of laughter broke Jim from his reverie and drew his attention
to the other side of the room, where Daniel and Blair were making
their own preparations.  He resisted the impulse to listen in;
respect of privacy was paramount to his principles as a Sentinel and
to his values as a man, particularly where his relationship with
Blair was concerned.  It didn&rsquo;t stop him being curious, though.</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blair
couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle inwardly as Daniel turned an adorable
shade of pink and actually shuffled his feet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">What?&rdquo;
he spluttered, obviously caught off guard by the unexpected question,
which was how Blair had planned it.  &ldquo;I, uh, well &ndash; oh, I
don&rsquo;t know, Blair.  What if he&rsquo;s not interested?  What if
he doesn&rsquo;t want me that way?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Oh,
well, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; Blair mused, then continued in a
high-pitched impression of a teenage girl.  &ldquo;Hey, I know! 
Jack&rsquo;s friends with my boyfriend, right?  Well, why don&rsquo;t
I, like, get my boyfriend to ask him out for you, huh?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
grinned again as Daniel snorted and punched him lightly on the
shoulder.  &ldquo;Okay, okay, you&rsquo;re right &ndash; I *am*
acting a bit like an adolescent girl over this, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Yup!
 Look, Daniel, I know it&rsquo;s clich&eacute;, but nothing ventured,
nothing gained, man.  Take the bull by the horns, risk it all for
love, okay?&rdquo;  Blair gripped Daniel&rsquo;s forearm and captured
his gaze.  &ldquo;Anything you have with Jack will be a relationship
of equals so, whatever you do, *please* don&rsquo;t turn into the
stereotypical, submissive science nerd.  It&rsquo;s beneath you.  Let
him know you mean business!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
looked somewhat apprehensive.  &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll think about
it&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With
a groan, Blair countered, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t think &ndash; act! 
Thinking is always your downfall.  This is not a situation that calls
for brains, my friend &ndash; it&rsquo;s balls you need for this
one.&rdquo;  He smirked.  &ldquo;And believe me, they&rsquo;ll get
their reward!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
Blair got his reward as Daniel nearly choked.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Don't

that I'm on the case!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

Daniel replied ruefully, turning away to pick up his pack.</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>***</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
watched Daniel and Blair&rsquo;s animated conversation with a touch
of envy, wishing he could be in on whatever joke they were sharing. 
He had filled the role of Daniel&rsquo;s oldest friend for years, and
now Sandburg had arrived to usurp his position with ease.  Not that
Jack begrudged Blair that right; on the contrary, he was delighted to
see Daniel so happy, it was just that he didn&rsquo;t quite know
where he stood with him any more.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
was impossible not to like Sandburg, though.  He&rsquo;d taken the
SGC by storm with his easy charm and natural friendliness.  He had
all the women on the base eating out of his hand, and no few of the
men, General Hammond included.  Even Teal'c had fallen prey to what
Jim referred to as The Sandburg Zone, extending the protectiveness he
had previously reserved for Daniel to include the diminutive
anthropologist.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
considered Jim to be a valuable addition to the project, too.  The
former detective was a good, solid man, a respected commander by all
reports, and his Sentinel abilities would certainly be an asset on
missions.  Altogether, Jack heartily approved of the results of
Daniel&rsquo;s recruitment trip to Cascade, and he was looking
forward to the upcoming mission.  That is, if he could separate the
Anthropology Twins long enough for them to get any work done.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He
caught Jim&rsquo;s eye and motioned him over.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">So,
Captain Ellison, you ready for your first mission?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">I

you really wanted to ask me.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Damn,
the man was perceptive!  Jack cleared his throat to cover his
confusion before deciding he might as well take the plunge since Jim
had made the opening.  He jerked his head to where Daniel and Blair
were practically giggling together over something, and asked,
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that make you jealous?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim
regarded him steadily.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied calmly.  &ldquo;In
actual fact, I think it&rsquo;s great.  Not to sound egotistical, but
Sandburg hasn&rsquo;t had much of a life outside of me for quite a
while.  We&rsquo;ve lived together, worked together and hung out
together for the better part of four years now, and I think any time
we spend apart on separate interests or with other friends can only
be a good thing.  Besides,&rdquo; he added, tapping the side of his
nose and smiling wryly, &ldquo;if Sandburg ever cheated on me,
believe me, I&rsquo;d know!&rdquo;  The he sobered again and pinned
Jack with an intense look.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for their
friendship to make you jealous either, you know.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
stared back at Jim, his mouth working but no sound coming out of it. 
After far too long a moment, he managed to splutter, &ldquo;Of course
not!  Why on earth would I be jealous?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jim
responded with a tight smile.  &ldquo;Blair and Daniel have been
friends for fifteen years,&rdquo; he reminded Jack.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
be very unwise to try and come between them.  But, having said that,
in all that time they&rsquo;ve never been anything more than friends.
 How you make use of that information is up to you, but I can tell
you for certain that Daniel isn&rsquo;t interested in *Blair* that
way &ndash; never has been and never will be.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With
that, Jim gave Jack&rsquo;s shoulder a brief squeeze and then turned
to collect his pack and head for the Gate Room.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
was left completely stunned by the conversation.  The implications of
what Jim had said sent his brain reeling.  Was it possible that Jim
had been suggesting Daniel might be interested in *him*?  The context
of their dialogue, and Jim&rsquo;s emphasis on Blair not being the
object of Daniel&rsquo;s affections could certainly be construed that
way.  Jack had wanted to get closer to Daniel for a long time but had
been afraid to test the waters because of the whole situation with
Sha&rsquo;re.  The last thing he wanted to do was lose Daniel because
his hormones got in the way of his sensitivity.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even
Sha&rsquo;re&rsquo;s death hadn&rsquo;t created an opportunity, in
fact serving to push Jack and Daniel further apart.  Jack had
desperately wanted to offer Daniel comfort but had been worried that
he would be unable to give his friend the support he needed without
his deeper feelings causing unwarranted complications in the
situation.  Daniel had found comfort elsewhere, in the company of
Sandburg, and Jack&rsquo;s role in Daniel&rsquo;s life had become
less certain.  They were still friends &ndash; nothing had really
changed &ndash; it was just that Sandburg&rsquo;s arrival on the
scene had altered the group dynamic.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now,
though, Jim seemed to be suggesting that, while the position of
Daniel&rsquo;s best friend might already be taken, there was an
opening for Jack to take up the role in Daniel&rsquo;s life that he
had wanted for so long &ndash; that of lover and partner.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack
decided to take the plunge while the prospect was fresh in his mind,
and before he had a chance to wimp out.  As Daniel and Blair preceded
him out of the room, he caught hold of Daniel's sleeve and held him
back.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif">Hey,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Daniel
momentarily looked as if someone had hit him in the back of the head
with something heavy, then a smile spread across his face.  &ldquo;Sure,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
