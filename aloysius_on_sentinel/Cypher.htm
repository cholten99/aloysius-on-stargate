<P>The ep starts with a great image of Jim and Blair hanging out together off duty, but the manly pursuit of watching sports is given the old married couple spin by Jim complaining that Blair made him stay right to the end so they got caught in all the post-game traffic.</P>

<P>Then we get Blair back in his proper place – right behind Jim as they answer a call on the police radio.  He’s still very new to police work, though, and the first sign of that in this episode comes with his reaction to the body in the bathtub.  Poor Blair – following Jim around maybe the culmination of his academic dream, but it does subject him to some pretty horrible stuff.</P>

<P>Simon looks rather strange without his glasses, but that’s not the problem with the next scene.  Bringing the audience up to speed on the case is necessary, but the stilted exposition really jars at the three characters recap on the previous victims, telling each other things they all know already so we know what’s going on.</P>

<P>Now, I’m really not keen on Blair’s girlfriend – no big surprise there!  But on top of the fact that she disrupts the slash ideal, she’s spectacularly unsympathetic towards our poor, traumatised baby.  I guess, given Blair’s previously implied promiscuity, it’s understandable for her to jump to the wrong conclusion when Blair mentions another woman, but that doesn’t make me dislike her any less.</P>

<P>Insult to injury is Jim’s little lecture on the importance of being immune to grisly murder scenes.  He’s only trying to be helpful in training Blair and protecting him, but poor Blair looks positively picked on by the end of the scene.  We do get a rather nice peek at his chest hair through his open shirt, though – so there are *some* good things about the scene for the more shallow viewer, like me!</P>

<P>I like the fact that Jim sticks up for Blair when Simon and Carolyn suggest he could be the leak.  The trust and faith are already firmly established despite Blair’s inexperience.</P>

<P>I’ve read a couple of stories where the leather jacket Blair wears to the funeral is actually Jim’s and I can see where the idea comes from – it does look a little big on him.  It’s quite a nice idea, too.</P>

<P>Jim’s concern over the possibility of the funeral being open casket is sweet, but Blair’s obviously still feeling self-conscious about his reaction at the scene, since he responds rather defensively.  Of course, inexperience rears its ugly head again when Blair starts gesturing frantically to point Jim’s attention towards the killer – not exactly the most subtle of tactics.</P>

<P>Jim’s destructive driving gets a look-in as he loses his rooflights while chasing Lash after the funeral.</P>

<P>Jim’s sticking up for Blair again, just like with his illegal surveillance of Juno:</P>
<P>Simon: What’s this I hear about Sandburg tipping off the suspect at the church?</P>
<P>Jim: I’m the one who blew it, sir – it’s my responsibility.</P>

<P>Simon’s still not totally under Blair’s spell yet, but the sincerity and conviction in Jim’s voice when he says he trusts Blair is really wonderful.</P>

<P>Having a serial killer impersonate the forensic psychiatrist called in to consult on the case is just brilliant, and I love Jim and Simon’s exchange of baffled looks when he starts talking about psychological dynamics.</P>

<P>Jim may be firm in his defence of Blair when he’s talking to Simon, but he doesn’t show it with Blair himself.  He’s careful to reassure Blair that he’s not angry with him, but when Blair asks him if he thinks he’s the leak, Jim evades the question.  Talk about emotional constipation!  Then he stomps on Blair’s offer to ask questions at Club Doom - *we* know he’s trying to protect Blair, but it’s easy to see how Blair could misconstrue the whole thing as a lack of faith in him.</P>

<P>Of course, Blair goes anyway in an attempt to prove himself, and Jim doesn’t know him well enough yet to predict that this is exactly what he’s going to do.</P>

<P>Blair in excited mode is just adorable!  He bursts into Simon’s office:</P>
<P>Blair: Okay, I’ve got this whole thing figured out.</P>
<P>Simon: Don’t you knock?</P>
<P>Blair: Oh right, sorry, Simon.  [Reaches behind him and knocks on the already open door.]</P>
<P>Cute and funny – what more do you need?</P>

<P>The fact that Lash can sit in Simon’s office and detail his own psychological profile is rather interesting.  And I love the deadly glare Blair throws Jim’s way when he dismisses it all as useless theory.  There’s definitely some resentment going on regarding Jim’s attitude.</P>

<P>Several police cars follow Jim to the maritime museum and yet he’s the only one who goes inside.  I guess they could be setting up a perimeter so the suspect can’t get away, but it seems odd for him to be without back-up when they’re all there.</P>

<P>It’s a shame the only person Blair gets any praise from is a psycho serial killer who’s targeting him as his next victim.  Knowing that the psychiatrist is really Lash, I hate the way he says Blair’s name.  It gives me chills, even though there’s nothing sinister about it.  The way Blair looks between Jim and Simon after Lash praises his work is really sad – it’s as if he’s thinking he’d far rather be getting praise from one or both of them.</P>

<P>The story of Lash’s childhood is fairly horrific – once again, this show doesn’t pull any punches.  Jim and Blair share an obvious distaste for what Lash’s father tells them.</P>

<P>Blair admitting to Chris that he thought she might be the leak is just a tad idiotic, but at least it gets rid of her…  When she has the gall to say, &quot;I was there for you&quot;, I always want to throw things at the TV.</P>

<P>However, my dislike of Chris is quickly replaced by the chills again as we see Lash lurking in the bushes in his Blair outfit.  Seeing him dressed up as Blair is really, really creepy.</P>

<P>I love it when Blair talks to himself – it’s really cute and I can totally relate.  I have an over-active imagination and quite often give myself instructions out loud when I’m scaring myself in my head.  (I’m not crazy, honest!)</P>

<P>Jim lifting weights and changing his shirt is rather a nice sight, but somewhat overshadowed by the tension of what’s happening to Blair.</P>

<P>Question – when he can’t get through to Jim, why on earth doesn’t Blair call Simon at the station???</P>

<P>I like the fact that Jim uses Blair’s first name when he calls out to him on arrival at the trashed loft.</P>

<P>Then we get the classic scenario of Blair in chains in a dingy warehouse, at the mercy of a psycho serial killer – it doesn’t get much better than this!  That is, until we get Jim angst in reaction to the knowledge that Blair is chained up in a dingy warehouse at the mercy of a psycho serial killer!</P>

<P>Lash is seriously creepy – and ‘Hairy Blairy’ is *not* a good nickname.  Good job Jim has plenty of others for him.  Blair’s taunting of Lash is brilliant.  Not only does it distract and delay him, but it also gives sound for Jim to zero in on.  Blair really shows his mettle under pressure here.</P>

<P>Jim manages to lose two guns while fighting Lash, but his use of five bullets to make sure he’s dead shows just how much Blair’s abduction got to him.  Obviously, I would have like to see Jim untie Blair and give him a big hug, but I guess I’ll just have to be content with Jim saying Blair did everything right (finally, some praise – yay!), the beginning of his role as Blair’s Blessed Protector, and the revelation that he knows about Blair’s nipple ring…</P>

<P>One of the best Blair-whumping scenarios – and excellent fodder for slash fanfiction.</P>
