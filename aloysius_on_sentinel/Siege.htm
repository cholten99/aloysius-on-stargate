<P>The disjointed voiceover on the credits sequence sounds a little strange – another early aspect of the show that I’d forgotten about.  I guess it gets across all the important info but having snippets of dialogue that Blair is directing at Jim makes for an odd way to impart information to the audience.</P>

<P>There’s a distinct shift in Jim’s attitude between the end of the first episode and the start of this one.  In Switchman, he introduces Blair to Joel as &quot;my new partner&quot;, but here Blair says, &quot;I know, I know, I’m never to refer to us as partners.&quot;  Jim’s obviously had time to think about the situation and get all paranoid and hesitant about it – shame!  Blair’s enthusiasm isn’t dampened in the slightest, though, and he continues to give as good as he gets – there’s never a time when he lets Jim intimidate him.</P>

<P>We cut straight from classic Jim/Blair banter to the intrigue of a dead policeman in the trunk of a car and two imposters heading into the building.  Good way to remind us that we’re not just here to enjoy the interaction between two great guys – there might actually be plot and stuff, too!</P>

<P>Blair’s presentation of his thesis idea to Simon is so beautifully sincere.  It’s hard to believe that the owner of those gorgeous eyes could be such a convincing liar.  Simon’s reaction is bemusement – the Sandburg Effect hasn’t got to him yet, but I think he’s more surprised at Jim’s apparent willingness to take Blair on than anything else.</P>

<P>Jim’s ‘family thing’ argument is pure genius.  He know exactly how to present the situation to Simon in order to persuade him, making this a rare occasion when it’s Jim’s use of words that wins the day rather than Blair’s.</P>

<P>The introduction of Daryl as a sulky, ingrateful teenager is not the best way to get me to like him.  I’m not a fan of kids, and this particular brand is one of my least favourites.  It certainly makes me more sympathetic towards Simon, though, and Daryl does grow on me.  He’s not a bad kid, really.</P>

<P>Blair is now calling Jim ‘Jim’, which is a relief – I knew the ‘Ellison’ thing in Switchman wouldn’t last long.</P>

<P>The dead cop earlier on is added to by the imposters casually executing all the people in the dispatch room.  All the violence is off screen, but it reinforces that this isn’t a fluffy show.  The tone of the Jim/Blair partnership may be fairly light, but there’s potential for heavy levels of angst here.</P>

<P>The continuing friendly vibe between Carolyn and Jim is nice – there interaction is a good way to reveal more about Jim’s character.  Here, we get the first reference to Jim’s love of Wonderburger, which gets a lot of mentions in fanfiction.</P>

<P>I love the way Blair grins and shakes his head in despair when Jim says Vera’s perfume reminds him of his grandmother.  Vera seems fairly immune to the Sandburg Effect, too, though, so it’s a strike-out for both guys on this one.</P>

<P>The brief mentions of Kincaid rather heavy-handedly make sure we know he’s bad news before he’s revealed as the leader of the men infiltrating the PD.  More character info on Jim, though, as we learn that he feels responsible for keeping the city safe and tends to berate himself if a criminal gets away.</P>

<P>The way the bad guys get rid of all the field officers with their emergency announcement is pretty clever.  It’s always good to have reasonably intelligent bad guys – it makes the heroes look even better when they defeat them anyway.</P>

<P>Rhonda’s great – she shows good thinking in stopping Daryl from revealing who his father is, and remains impressively calm.  Joel shows equally good instincts and courage in attempting to escape – a different response to the situation but just as appropriate to his character.</P>

<P>And so Blair get so play Die Hard – though at least he gets to keep his shoes and socks on…</P>

<P>Jim gets to show off his penchant for reckless driving with a rubber-burning u-turn in his very cool truck, and he also demonstrates his growing control of his senses by spotting the concealed gunman on his return to the station.</P>

<P>In case we hadn’t already realised that Kincaid is *not* a nice man, he stamps on Joel’s injured leg, yells at Rhonda and threatens Daryl with a gun all in the space of ten seconds – I think we’ve got he picture now!</P>

<P>There’s a nice exploration of Jim’s relationhip with Simon on his arrival at the scene.  They’re more friends than boss and employer – Jim uses Simon’s first name to get through to him when he panics about Daryl being in the building, and does a good job at combining physical restraining and logical reasoning to get him focused on what's best to do.</P>

<P>Blair’s tendency to land in trouble at every opportunity is reinforced by him getting involved in a hostage situation on his first day at the PD, and his flair for creative weaponry gets a good demonstration when he takes out two bad guys with a toilet door and a vending machine, respectively!  Always the opportunist, our Blair, and never one to give up without a fight.  He turns an accident that reveals him to the enemy into a victory over the bad guys twice, and you have to give him points for thinking on his feet.</P>

<P>Blair’s eclectic love life gets its first mention in his desperate promise to a higher power that he’ll stop lying to three different women if he gets out of the situation alive.</P>

<P>The bad guys are rather bemused by Blair, too – it seems to be a common reaction:</P>
<P>Baddie 1: Any sign of the bogey?</P>
<P>Baddie 2: No, but he took Van Dyke out with a vending machine.</P>
<P>Baddie 1: A what?</P>
<P>Baddie 2: A vending machine!</P>

<P>Jim and Simon make an excellent team.  They work together really well, and look very good in their assault gear.  Simon’s growing confusion over how Jim know various things is great, and a good build up to him being brought into the Sentinel secret.</P>

<P>Blair’s total failure to break a window with a chair is so cute!  Full marks for effort, though, and determination too, since he immediately locates a better tool and tries again.  The guy just will not give up – a trait he certainly needs when dealing with Jim every day.</P>

<P>Blair’s instant background story is absolutely brilliant – and lends credence to another idea that gets a lot of mention in fanfiction, namely Blair being mistaken for a Narcotics officer or being headhunted by Narcotics.  The way Joel backs him up is really sweet – even this early, the other cops are looking out for Blair.</P>

<P>Despite his fear and occasional moments of panic when trying to evade the bad guys, when eventually face to face with Kincaid, Blair instantly turns into Mr Cool and refuses to be fazed by Kincaid’s threats and intimidation.  Of course, he makes an instant impression and ends up as Kincaid’s personal hostage during the escape – no surprises there, if something *can* happen to Blair, it will.</P>

<P>Joel plays hero for a second time and proves in no uncertain terms that he a very cool guy.  Even with a wounded leg, he still manages to take out one of the bad guys.  Daryl does pretty well in the end, too, almost taking out the other one.  Definitely a chip off the old block!</P>

<P>Jim speeding out onto the roof to save Blair is wonderful.  As with all these type of moments, you can see it simply as him going after Kincaid, but I choose to see all his determination being focused on getting to Blair.</P>

<P>Simon proves fairly inventive himself, stopping the bad guys’ van from getting away by reversing a police cruiser into it.  And of course the cavalry arrives just in time to back him up, in the form of the returning field officers.  Very neatly concluded.</P>

<P>There’s great unspoken teamwork between Jim and Blair when Kincaid opens the helicopter door and Jim grabs him just as Blair shoves him out.  Then Blair yet again comes up with a brilliant and outrageous lie to convince the pilot to turn the helicopter around – &quot;I flew Apaches in Desert Storm!&quot;  He’s just great – and his imagination is truly staggering!</P>

<P>Even after being shot at, jumping out of a window, taken hostage and nearly arrested, Blair’s enthusiasm is still sky high.  His reaction to Simon saying he’s on the team is adorable.</P>

<P>The we get the perfect ending – Blair being clearly terrified that Simon finding out about Jim’s senses will end the whole thing before it’s even begun, Jim being clearly delighted that that isn’t the case and cupping Blair’s face in his hands as he reassures him, and Blair once again being forced to jog after Jim because he’s only got little legs – cute, cute, cute!</P>

<P>Another great establishing episode, with the Jim/Blair relationship being further developed, the introduction of Daryl, some great character information all round, and the initiation of Simon into the Sentinel Secret.</P>

<P>Very good stuff!</P>
