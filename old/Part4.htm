words played over and over in Jack’s head as the elevator crawled its way down
to Sub Level 28.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This broken record
thing in his mind was becoming a habit, one that was really starting to annoy
Jack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He wasn’t surprised that it was
Daniel who had finally driven him over the edge into insanity, but he was still
having trouble with the manner in which it had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>However,
at that precise moment, the thoughts that were trying to make themselves heard
over the endless cycle of Daniel’s last words to him, were wondering what kind
of a mess Daniel had managed to get himself into this time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why had he let Daniel go off to Galia
without him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel always got into
trouble when he went on assignment with other teams.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Well, Jack had to admit Daniel got into trouble fairly regularly
on missions with SG-1, too, but at least on those occasions Jack was there to
get him out of it, or even just share in it with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Now, he was stuck in an excruciatingly slow elevator, wondering
what might be happening on another planet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>The
elevator finally stopped and Jack practically ran out of its opening
doors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He burst into the briefing room,
barely noticing General Hammond and Admiral Dant, and made straight for Major
Kovachek, who rose from his seat in alarm at Jack’s entrance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>“What
the hell is going on, Kovachek?” Jack demanded, stabbing a finger in the
Major’s face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I entrust my
archaeologist to you, and you manage to lose him in less than 24 hours!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Kovachek
didn’t get a chance to respond, since General Hammons interrupted with a sharp
reprimand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Colonel O’Neill!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Jack
snapped back into an at ease position and muttered, “Sorry, sir.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>“I understand
your frustration, Colonel,” Hammond continued, his tone still stern, “but I
would appreciate no further outbursts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I suggest you change into uniform, collect the rest of your team and
report back here in a few minutes.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Jack
glanced down at the jeans, t-shirt and leather jacket he was wearing, then
raised his head to meet the General’s gaze again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Fifteen
minutes later, Jack was back, this time in uniform and with Carter and Teal’c
in tow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had met Carter coming out of
the locker room; she had obviously made the sensible choice to get ready before
she reported to General Hammond, and had offered to go and find Teal’c while
Jack got changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, they presented a
calm, professional and united front as they entered the briefing room and took
their seats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jack kept his expression
carefully neutral, fighting the urge to shoot glares at Kovachek, since he knew
he was on thin ice with the General after his earlier display.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Hammond
waited until they were all settled, then turned to Kovachek.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>With a
slightly nervous glance in Jack’s direction, Kovachek gave his report.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>“We
arrived on Galia early evening local time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Dr Jackson made all the introductions and we were assigned quarters at
the Exploration Centre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then we were
invited to join Admiral Dant, Chancellor Glarris and some others for
dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Commander Ravell and Officer
Penthar departed for their homes shortly after we arrived, but Jayven Melawei
stayed with us the whole time and attended the dinner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Afterwards, my team and I decided to retire
for the night, but Jayven asked Dr Jackson if he wanted to see some of the
city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I arranged with Dr Jackson that
we’d meet up this morning; Jayven was to join us as well, but neither of them
turned up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Admiral Dant sent someone to
Jayven’s home, but it looks like he never made it back there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nobody’s seen or heard from either of them
since they left the Exploration Centre last night.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Admiral
Dant spoke up for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“We’ve got investigators out in the city trying to track their
movements, and the Galaya are convening to try their own methods of
location.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He looked at Jack.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Please be assured that we are devoting all
our resources to finding them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However,
we would be more than willing for you and your team to come back with us and
aid in the search.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Jack
opened his mouth to say the Galians would be hard pressed to stop him, but
General Hammond cut him off before he could even formulate the first word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>“Thank
you, Admiral,” Hammond said, throwing a look at Jack that told him in no
uncertain terms that the General wouldn’t tolerate any attitude from him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“We appreciate your openness and spirit of
co-operation.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Jack had
an awful lot he wanted to say, but decided he was better off keeping his mouth
shut, since he wasn’t sure he’d be able to control his temper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, he looked across at Carter, hoping
she’d understand and ask some of the questions to which he wanted answers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Evidently, her entirely human telepathic skills
were primed, since she nodded almost imperceptibly before turning to Admiral
Dant and leaning forwards on her forearms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you any idea what might have happened to them?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

could outline some possibilities for us.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>At the
look of confusion on the Admiral’s face, she continued, “What I mean is, are
there any usual explanations when people go missing on Galia – such as traffic
accidents, targeted muggings, random street violence…?”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Carter trailed off as the Admiral’s
expression shifted from confusion to outright horror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>“Major!”
he exclaimed in the ensuing silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I
would never presume to suggest that we live in a perfect society on Galia, but the
idea that two people would be unable to walk the streets of our capital city in
safety is preposterous, especially if one of them is Galayan.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Jack’s
control finally snapped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“For crying
out loud, Admiral, if they were perfectly safe, they wouldn’t have
disappeared!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And if this kind of thing
never happens on Galia, there can’t be that many possibilities.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of getting angrier, Dant suddenly looked distinctly uncomfortable, and Jack
knew he’d hit upon something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He just
wasn’t sure he was going to like what the Admiral was going to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are people on Galia who have always been against the Galayan Portal research
and, in recent weeks, we have had some trouble with protesters opposing the
Exploration Units.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The most likely
explanation we’ve come up with for the disappearance of Daniel Jackson and
Jayven Melawei is that they’ve fallen victim to some kind of political attack
against the policy of exploration.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cleared his throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“We had no idea
they were organised enough to pose this kind of threat and, besides, up until
know, all the protests have been relatively small and entirely peaceful.<span

O’Neill, and I still find it very difficult to believe any of our citizens
