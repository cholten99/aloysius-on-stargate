<P>Frodo heard Merry and Pippin before he saw them.  They were bickering, as per usual, and, as they came into view, he could guess why.  Both of the other hobbits were covered head to toe in mud, squelching along the path together, arguing as they went.  Frodo had to stifle a smile at their thunderous expressions, knowing that if he made fun of their predicament he would likely never get an explanation.  Instead, he feigned concern and called out to them as they got nearer.</P>

<P>&quot;What on earth happened to the pair of you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You tell him,&quot; Merry said, elbowing Pippin in the ribs.</P>

<P>&quot;No, you tell him,&quot; Pippin replied grumpily.</P>

<P>&quot;But it was your fault!&quot; Merry protested.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, it was your idea!&quot; Pippin countered.</P>

<P>Frodo could tell this new thread of their argument might well go on forever if he didn’t intervene, so he held up his hands to quiet them and said, &quot;Pippin – you tell me.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry glowered at him and crossed his arms, waiting with obvious suspicion for Pippin to tell the tale.</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Pippin said, &quot;it all began when Merry came round to my house this morning…&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>&quot;Pippin!&quot; the familiar voice called from outside.  &quot;You awake yet?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin stuck his head out of the window, making Merry jump.  &quot;Of course I’m awake, silly!  What are you doing here?&quot;</P>

<P>Merry grinned and waved the rod and line he held in his hand.  &quot;It’s such a lovely day, I thought you might like to go fishing.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin thought for a moment.  Fishing wasn’t his favourite passtime – he didn’t really have the patience for it – but spending the day outside in the sun with Merry was much more preferable to staying indoors.  Sweeping out the kitchen could wait until another day.</P>

<P>&quot;Alright,&quot; he agreed, retreating back into the house.  &quot;Just let me get my things and I’ll be right with you!&quot; he called over his shoulder.</P>

<P>A few minutes later, the two hobbits were heading towards the river, fishing gear in their hands and a hastily gathered lunch packed in their knapsacks.  Merry chose a shady spot next to some trees and they both cast their lines into the gently flowing water.</P>

<P>They chatted as they fished, passing the time by talking about nothing and simply enjoying one another’s company.</P>

<P>It was some time later that Pippin’s line suddenly jerked and their attention was immediately fixed on the river.</P>

<P>&quot;I’ve got one!&quot; Pippin cried, clutching his fishing rod tightly.</P>

<P>However, before he could do anything, Merry pushed him roughly aside and grabbed the rod himself.  &quot;Let me do it,&quot; he said condescendingly.  &quot;You’ll only lose it if you…&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; Merry cried indignantly.  &quot;You lying wretch!  That’s not what happened at all and you know it!&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo swallowed his mirth as Pippin regarded Merry with stunned horror.</P>

<P>&quot;Are you trying to suggest,&quot; Pippin said with great dignity, &quot;that I am deliberately misleading our fine friend here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying,&quot; Merry declared.  Then he turned to Frodo.  &quot;Don’t listen to him, Frodo.  He’s telling it all wrong.  What really happened was…&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>They chatted as they fished, passing the time by talking about nothing and simply enjoying one another’s company.</P>

<P>It was some time later that Pippin stuck his rod into the soft earth of the riverbank and stepped backwards, stretching and yawning.</P>

<P>&quot;Haven’t you had enough yet?&quot; he asked petulantly.  &quot;I’m bored, Merry.  Let’s find something else to do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But we haven’t caught anything yet!&quot; Merry protested.</P>

<P>And it was at that moment that Pippin’s rod suddenly jerked and their attention was immediately fixed on the river.  Merry reached for the rod and grabbed it just before the fish on the other end could pull it free.  He planted his feet firmly and began to pull gently so as not to allow the fish to slip off the hook.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, that’s my rod!&quot; Pippin exclaimed.  &quot;Let me do it!&quot;</P>

<P>He tried to shove Merry out of the way and claim possession of the rod again, but Merry wasn’t about to let him have it.  They grappled for a while, both trying to land the fish.  Finally, Pippin lost patience, took hold of the rod and yanked it backwards with all his strength.  The fish flew out of the water and landed on the grass a little way from the river, where it lay gasping in the air.</P>

<P>Both hobbits dropped the rod and dived for the creature.</P>

<P>&quot;That fish is mine!&quot; Pippin cried.</P>

<P>&quot;If I’d left it to you, we would have lost the fish and the rod!&quot; Merry argued.  &quot;It’s mine!&quot;</P>

<P>They rolled around on the ground, alternately reaching for the fish and pushing each other away.  Their movements soon churned up the soft earth and they quickly became covered in mud.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>&quot;And that’s how we ended up like this,&quot; Merry concluded.</P>

<P>But Frodo still had one more question.  &quot;Does either of you actually have the fish?&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin exchanged sheepish glances and then both looked at their feet.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, um, no…&quot; Pippin mumbled.</P>

<P>Merry continued.  &quot;While we were fighting over whose it was, the fish managed to wriggle over to the bank and jump back into the water.&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo couldn’t help himself any longer.  He burst out laughing.</P>

<P>&quot;You two are absolutely hopeless!&quot; he said.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
