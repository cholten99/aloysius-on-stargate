<P>He loves me.  I know he loves me.</P>

<P>He comes to me every night and takes me in his arms.  He holds me close, his strong embrace encircling my frail body and making me feel so safe.</P>

<P>He buries his face in my hair and breathes deeply of my scent.  His lips caress my neck, marking his territory on my skin.  His body shudders with suppressed need as he slowly moves his tongue across my flesh, seeking out one particular spot.</P>

<P>Then he bites, breaking through the scabs that are barely healing from the night before, and my blood begins to flow.  He drinks of me, taking my life into his.</P>

<P>I am his oxygen, his sustenance.  Without me, he cannot live, without him, I have no purpose.</P>

<P>His hold on me tightens as my strength passes into him and I feel more alive than ever in giving him what he needs.  Every touch, every caress is more real when we are so joined; this is my world, my happiness.</P>

<P>I am his to do with as he pleases, and I give myself freely, my need for this connection as great as his for my blood.  He holds me silently for a moment at the end, and then he is gone, leaving me weak but fulfilled – until the next night when he will come again.</P>

<P>He loves me.  I know he loves me.</P>
