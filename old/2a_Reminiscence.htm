<P>&quot;Oi, Merry!  Watch what you’re doing.  You could have fallen right over the edge!&quot;</P>

<P>The familiar voice shook Merry out of his thoughts and a pair of sturdy arms wrapped themselves around him from behind, pulling him firmly back from where the ground dropped away at his feet.</P>

<P>He turned and looked into the concerned eyes of Pippin, who maintained his grip around Merry’s waist, despite the fact that they both now stood on solid ground.</P>

<P>&quot;What were you doing?&quot; Pippin asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Just thinking,&quot; Merry told him.  &quot;Thinking about the time we really did fall over the edge.  Do you remember?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course I remember!&quot; Pippin exclaimed.  &quot;We were running away from Farmer Maggot and we met Frodo and Sam in the corn field.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry looked back over Pippin’s shoulder at the very corn field of which he spoke, and sighed.  &quot;Things were so different then,&quot; he said wistfully.  &quot;So much more simple.&quot;  He gazed back into Pippin’s face, remembering how young and full of innocence it had once been.  Now there were lines marring Pippin’s boyish features, lines that spoke of things seen and things done.  &quot;That was the day it all changed,&quot; he said.  &quot;The day the world got suddenly so much bigger and so much more frightening.  I often wonder how things might have turned out if we hadn’t gone after Farmer Maggot’s carrots that day.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin searched his expression, a different worry now shining in his eyes.  &quot;Do you wish we hadn’t?&quot; he asked.</P>

<P>In answer, Merry tightened his embrace and buried his face in Pippin’s neck.  &quot;No, of course not,&quot; he reassured the other hobbit.  &quot;What we gained is so much greater than what we lost.&quot;  He brought his head back up and planted the lightest of kisses on Pippin’s lips.  &quot;I wouldn’t give up what we have for a lifetime of safety and innocence in the Shire.&quot;  He turned the tables on Pippin.  &quot;Would you?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin reached up and stroked one finger down the side of Merry’s face.  When he spoke, his voice was soft.  &quot;No, Merry.  If it was the only way for me to have you, I’d do it all over again, exactly the same.  I told you I wouldn’t leave you, and I meant it.&quot;</P>

<P>His words instantly took Merry back to another place and time.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>He lay on rough ground, a creeping cold gradually spreading throughout his body.  The pain he had felt when he drove his dagger into the leg of the Black Rider was gone, but it had been replaced by a crippling weakness and an inability to think clearly.  He was so tired, but he knew he had to hold on just a little bit longer because Pippin would surely be there soon.</P>

<P>As if summoned by his thoughts, the bright voice of his beloved friend pierced the darkness in his mind, calling him back from oblivion.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!  Merry!&quot;</P>

<P>He struggled to open his eyes, fighting his way towards full consciousness.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!&quot; the voice said again, its tone insistent.  &quot;It’s me, Pippin.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry finally managed to focus on the pale face above him and he smiled to see the loving concern in Pippin’s eyes.</P>

<P>&quot;I knew you’d find me,&quot; he said with effort but, now that Pippin was actually here, a shiver of fear ran down his spine and doubt crept into his heart.  &quot;Are you going to leave me again?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, Merry,&quot; Pippin reassured him with a calm confidence Merry had never heard from him before.  &quot;I’m going to look after you.&quot;</P>

<P>The situation was all wrong, Merry thought.  He was the strong one, the leader, the protector, and Pippin was the one who needed looking after.  But it seemed their roles had suddenly been reversed, and it was so easy just to give up control to someone else.  There was something in Pippin’s voice that told Merry to trust him, so he allowed himself to drift off again, safe in the knowledge that his friend was there.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Merry floated in darkness for a long time.  It was very cold and he couldn’t feel anything.  The darkness beckoned to him and he prepared to give in to it.  Suddenly, though, a small point of light and warmth appeared off to one side and he felt a soft caress on his hand.  Somehow, he knew it was Pippin.  He knew Pippin loved him and he knew Pippin needed him.  As tempting as the darkness seemed to be at that moment, Merry knew Pippin would never forgive him if he left, so he made a supreme effort and moved towards the light.  It was a long way, and Merry was very tired, but he knew if he stopped he would never start again so he kept going, holding the thought of Pippin in the front of his mind to give him strength.</P>

<P>At last, the darkness melted away and he stepped out into a beautiful meadow, full of daisies.  He recognised it as the place he and Pippin had been accustomed to go when they were younger, to escape their chores on summer afternoons in the Shire.  Sure enough, there was Pippin, sitting beneath their favourite tree, which was covered in white blossom.  Pippin beckoned to him and gestured for him to lie down on the grass.  Unbelievably weary, Merry gladly did so, laying his head in Pippin’s lap.  Pippin took hold of his hand in one of his own and, with the other, stroked his fingers gently across Merry’s forehead.  He smiled.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s alright, Merry,&quot; Pippin said.  &quot;You can rest now.  I’ll watch over you.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry gratefully closed his eyes and went to sleep, safe in his friend’s care.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>When he finally awoke, Merry found himself in a soft feather bed in an unfamiliar room.  But he knew the touch of the hand that held his own and he looked across to see Pippin sitting beside him.  Before he could say anything, though, Gandalf’s voice took his attention to the other side of his bed.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, Master Meriadoc,&quot; the wizard said in his customary gruff tones.  &quot;You gave us all quite a scare.  Taking on the Witch-King of Angmar was perhaps not the wisest thing you have ever done, but I believe you will suffer no lasting harm from it.  And for that you may thank young Pippin here in part; he has not left your side since you were brought in from the battlefield.  I shall take my leave of you now,&quot; he concluded, turning to exit the room, but Merry heard him muttering as he left.  &quot;Hobbits!  They never cease to amaze me!&quot;</P>

<P>Merry immediately turned back to Pippin, who sat silently, simply gazing at him with an unreadable expression on his face.  He looked different; older and more assured.  The mischief that always used to glint in his eyes was gone, replaced by a weary sorrow that frightened Merry a little.  This was not the Pippin who had stolen fireworks from Gandalf’s cart under his instruction at Bilbo’s party.  This was not the Pippin who had seen life as an endless series of opportunities for having fun and causing trouble.  This was a Pippin who had touched the mind of The Enemy and survived the siege of Minas Tirith.  This was a Pippin whom Merry was not sure he really knew.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, Pip,&quot; Merry said at last, somewhat uncertainly.  &quot;Aren’t you going to say anything?&quot;</P>

<P>There was another long moment of silence, then Pippin smiled slowly and looked down at his feet awkwardly in a gesture that showed Merry his childhood friend was still in there somewhere.</P>

<P>&quot;I thought of so many things I wanted to say to you while I was waiting for you wake up,&quot; Pippin finally said.  &quot;But now, none of them seem quite right.  I thought I’d lost you, Merry, and I couldn’t bear it.  It made me think of all the things I’d never said and all the things I’d never done, and…&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin trailed off but, when he looked up directly into Merry’s eyes, there was something new in his expression; desire.  After a moment of shock, Merry felt an unexpected answering desire of his own surging up in his heart and he realised what all the changes meant.  Pippin had grown up in the short time they had been apart; he was his own person now, not simply an extension of Merry’s personality.  This was a Pippin he could love in a way that had never presented itself before.</P>

<P>Pippin apparently saw what he had hoped for in Merry’s changing expressions, because he slowly reached out and cupped Merry’s face with one hand.  Merry smiled his encouragement and was rewarded when Pippin leaned forwards and kissed him.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Back at the cliff on the edge of Farmer Maggot’s land, Merry absently rubbed his arm, a shadow-memory of his blow against the Witch-King sending a sudden chill through his flesh.  Pippin had stopped him falling over the edge back then, just as he had now, nearly four years later on the day after Frodo had left for the Undying Lands.  Where once Pippin had followed Merry’s lead, now they supported each other as equals, each able and willing to take the other’s weight when either of them stumbled.</P>

<P>Yes, the carefree innocence of their youth had been lost in the struggle against Sauron, but it had been replaced by something deeper and far more precious.</P>

<P>Besides, maturity didn’t mean they couldn’t still have fun.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you know what I’d really like right about now?&quot; Merry asked his lover, grinning impishly.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot; Pippin asked, clearly surprised by Merry’s sudden change of mood.</P>

<P>&quot;A carrot!&quot; Merry replied.</P>

<P>Pippin laughed and, grabbing Merry’s hand, ran with him back into Farmer Maggot’s field.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
