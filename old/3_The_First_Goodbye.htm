<P>Oh, Pippin, what have you done now?  And why didn’t I stop you?</P>

<P>The night of the party at Edoras, we were still full of the thrill of our victory at Isengard.  The people of Rohan were likewise joyful and boisterous after the defeat of Saruman’s army at Helm’s Deep and they welcomed us into their circle with open arms.  It was a wonderful respite from the fear and danger we had all experienced so recently and, deep down, we all knew it wouldn’t last, which made us want to enjoy ourselves all the more.  I had no inkling then that it would all go wrong again so soon – and you, my troublesome Took, at the heart of the chaos as always.</P>

<P>I noticed your look of disappointment and resentment when Gandalf took the globe from you at Isengard, but I did no pay it much mind at the time, ignorant as I was of the power and significance of the stone.  I should have known better – I should have know *you* better.  You never have been able to leave anything alone, especially if someone specifically tells you to do so.  I always feared your curiosity would one day get you into a situation that was beyond your ingenuity to get out of.  I had thought you might have learned that lesson once and for all in Moria, but apparently not even the death of a friend can dampen the meddling spirit of a Took.</P>

<P>That’s a little unfair – the loss of Gandalf in Moria affected you keenly, as it did us all.  But his glorious return and the illusion of safety brought about by the defeat of Saruman did much to remove our sense of caution, leaving you all the more open to temptation.</P>

<P>And what of me?  Meriadoc Brandybuck, your minder throughout most of your childhood, but later your partner and perhaps leader in mischief.  Should I have done more to instil in you the importance of sense and restraint, Pippin?  I have always looked after you, but perhaps I should have encouraged you to stand on your own more often, to accept the consequences of your actions rather than relying on me to sort out the messes you made.  I never dreamed, during those carefree years back in the Shire, that we would ever be a part of something so huge and important as this war we find ourselves fighting now.  We weren’t ready to face something like this and, despite our success with the Ents, you have just proved that we are still just lost little hobbits who are hopelessly out of our depth in this world of magic and power and evil.</P>

<P>And what have I proved?  That when the danger is greatest and you need me the most, I am of no use at all.  Not wanting to wake the others and land us in trouble, I offered only token persuasion to stop you from taking the globe.  Then, when the Enemy took hold of you and you lay writing and groaning on the floor, for all I know dying before my very eyes, I did nothing at all.  It was Aragorn who took the stone from your grasp and Gandalf who brought your mind back from whatever dark place it had been taken.  I simply sat by in frozen horror and watched the scene unfold, unable to act in any way to come to your aid.</P>

<P>I’m so sorry I failed you, Pippin.  At the first real test of my guardianship, I have been found sorely lacking, and now I don’t know what is going to happen.  You now lie safe in my arms, my whispered words of reassurance stilling your nightmares and my tears dampening your hair, but I fear you will not remain under my protection for long.  I feel a change is coming for both of us, my dear Pippin – the breaking of a fellowship that has lasted far longer than the one formed in Rivendell.  I believe our paths will soon start moving in different directions for the first time and we will have to see how we fare in this world alone.</P>

<P>Perhaps that will be best for you, perhaps you will be safer away from me.  All I know is that I will be lost without you by my side.  Be safe, dear Pippin, and come back to me before too long.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
