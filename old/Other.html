I don't feel like myself today, so pretending to be someone else will
take even more effort than usual, as non-consequential as that may
sound.  I need sustenance, but leaving the hotel to seek it out just
seems too difficult, involving as it would a certain level of
disguise and stealth.  But why step outside when I can just as easily
achieve my aim without stirring a muscle?</P>

I lie on my bed and close my eyes, opening them again in a different
way a moment later and rising from both bed and body to stand over
myself.  Everything immediately seems sharper, more distinct, and I
feel my senses stretching out in all directions, absorbing unknown
sounds and smells.  I watch my physical face spread into a grin.</P>

Gathering darkness about me, I move to the window and look out onto
the street below.  It is near night and the people are hurrying home,
but the shadows are my minions now and I will not be seen unless I
wish it.  I focus on the cobblestones and I am suddenly standing upon
them, the stone hard beneath my boots, which are not really there.</P>

I weave between the pedestrians, enjoying the sense of power that
comes from being among them and yet not so.  They have no idea of my
presence or my intent; they are oblivious to the fact that their fate
is in my hands.  I look closely at each one, taking my time over my
selection.  I am in no rush, so I might as well wait until the right
opportunity presents itself.</P>

There &ndash; a woman alone.  The last of those ahead of her turns
the corner and moves out of sight.  The street is ours alone, at
least for the moment.  I move behind her, brushing so close that I
can feel her breathing through the heavy material of her corset,
dress and overcoat.  Walking in time with her, I spread my arms wide
and pull substance into myself from my surroundings; weight from the
cobblestones, warmth from the streetlamps, the sound of my footsteps
from the rhythmic thud of hers.  I fashion myself a tailored suit, a
flowing coat and a top hat for good measure.</P>

She senses me and glances over her shoulder.  I hiss at her, flashing
my teeth and showing her what manner of creature has appeared at her
back.  She opens her mouth to scream and I leap between her lips,
dissipating my substance as quickly as I had gathered it, sliding
deep within her, choking her protest with my will.  I move beneath
her skin, stroking and caressing her from inside, a touch more
intimate than a lover's.  I work slowly, exploring every inch of her
body, flowing with her blood, squeezing past her organs, making her
my own.  I swirl inside her brain, circling her frozen consciousness,
relishing the terror that emanates from what little is left of her
mind.</P>

At last, my conquest of her being is complete and she moves with my
will, dragging her footsteps towards the door of the hotel, up the
stairs and into my room.  I walk with her up to the bed, where I look
down through her eyes upon myself lying there, waiting.</P>
