<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The stones surround me, their cold regiments standing always to attention as time moves on around them.  Their stasis matches my own, but the sweet smell of death that oozes from beneath them taunts me with that which I will never experience.</P>

<P>The names inscribed upon their faces are etched, each one, into my memory.  This is my family, my living place, full of cold comfort and bitter torment.  I watch the people, bright with life, who come to try to maintain a bond with their dead.  Though their efforts are futile, the strength and warmth of their emotion strikes me like a knife of regret.  They weep and wail as I stare at them, hidden in the shadows, indifferent to their pain, which cannot touch my own.</P>

<P>I weep for myself; there will never be anyone to weep for me.  I am alone in a way that none of them could ever imagine, whose lives have been touched by love.  Their petty grief sickens me, as they mourn what they have lost and what I will never have.  Their lives are small, their griefs are small; they come and go in their multitudes and I see them added one by one to the host in the ground beneath my feet.</P>

<P>I will never join them, so I walk above, trapped in immortal solitude, tracking the process of decay as they slowly rot away, leaving me untouched and alone in the empty air.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
