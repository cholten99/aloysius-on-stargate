<P>I walk in shadow; watching, ever watching the creatures of the light.  Not with envy; that is not what prompts my nightly observance of their rituals, their intrigues.  No, it is not envy, for they are not people to me, they are merely fodder for my desires.  It is hunger that drives me, a hunger that consumes and obsesses me, and that can never be assuaged.  I circle the edges of the crowd, examining each specimen with a careful and pedantic eye, searching for the one who may provide what I have been seeking for so long.</P>

<P>More than one admiring glance is cast in my direction; there are many here who would gladly place themselves within the sphere of my power.  As I observe the clumsy flirtation with which they try to catch my eye, a quotation springs to mind: What fools these mortals be.  They have no idea what fate awaits the one that proves my choice.  And yet, perhaps they do.  Perhaps, when all is said and done, these seemingly foolish and simplistic mortals are in fact far cleverer than I.  For every one of them, who has been my choice and encountered that fate, has experienced the very thing I crave.  My nightly encounters invariably end in frustration, and yet I find myself drawn to repeat them over and over, so perhaps indeed it is I who should be labelled the fool.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Later, I smile invitingly back over my shoulder as I lead my chosen victim to my rented rooms.  She squeezes my hand and looks up at me from beneath her blackened eyelashes, a crude and unnecessary trick to inspire attraction.  When we reach our destination, she pulls from my grasp and circles the bed, trailing her fingers along the coverlet as she backs away from me, teasing me with her eyes.  Sometimes, I like to linger over the preliminaries, but tonight I am not in the mood to play whatever game she has in mind.  I am growing impatient in my hunger and I need to feed.</P>

<P>I close the distance between us in two swift strides, reaching for the clothing that separates me from my prize.  I push her down onto the bed and rip the cloth from her body, exposing her small, white breasts.  She gasps, at first with surprise but then with awakening pleasure as I lower my mouth to her neck and begin to lick and nibble my way down her body.  Her arms come up to clutch at my jacket and she throws her head back with a moan, spreading her legs apart to invite me closer.</P>

<P>I waste no more time; the smooth, firm skin beneath my lips is too much of a temptation and I fasten my teeth to the point where the flesh first begins to swell out to form her breast and bite down hard.  Another gasp, and the blood wells up, answering my hunger with its ready flow.  I drink deeply as she writhes on the bed, half in pleasure, half in pain, my deathless body sucking the life from hers.</P>

<P>I want to see her as she gives me what I need to survive, so I break off my suckling and move my questing lips down her quivering arm to the pulse point at her wrist.  She is breathing heavily now, the flow of blood from the wound in her chest increased by the rapid beating of her heart just beneath it.  Her eyes are wide with shock but she does not fight me, nor does she scream, caught as she is in the spell of arousal that is woven by my erotic abuse of her flesh.</P>

<P>As I break the skin again, releasing her blood from its prison of veins, her features twist in an agony of ecstasy that builds with every swallow I take.  She moans again, the whimper of a creature that knows it is doomed but does not want to resist.  Her gasp and sigh of climax combine with the death rattle of her lungs and she reaches completion just as I drain her dry and let her lifeless hand fall from my lips.</P>

<P>My immediate hunger is sated but, as always, I am left feeling empty and unsatisfied.  I have ended another life, and yet all the pleasure in that act belonged to the victim, a fact which gives her the ultimate power in the encounter.  I remain as I have been for as long as I can remember; unmoved.  One hunger has been appeased, but the other, deeper hunger remains untouched, a constant ache that nothing seems to reach, and so my search fails yet again.</P>

<P>All I am left with is the irritating and undignified necessity of cleaning up the mess that is the inevitable result of my exploits.  With a sneer of contempt for myself and my situation, I reach beneath the corpse’s shoulders and lift her until she rests against me.  As I shift the body to get a better grip, something sharp in the intricate design of her hair catches on my lip and, in breaking free, tears the skin just above my mouth.  A few drops of blood tease their way past my lips and onto my tongue, and the faint stirrings of something long forgotten begin to awaken deep within my body.</P>

<P>My tongue darts out to find the wound, moving as if of its own volition to find more of this new and stimulating sustenance, but the skin has already closed over the cut, denying it.  I cast the corpse away from me, leaving it to fall as it will in the surprise of my discovery, and reach eagerly for the letter opener that lies on the table.  My frenzy makes me clumsy and it takes me three attempts before I can force the dulled metal through the skin of my wrist.  I fling the tool to the floor as soon as its job is done, and fasten my mouth to my arm, sucking frantically at my own juices.</P>

<P>As the thick sweetness of my blood finds its way down my throat, the sensations that began with that first accident now grow and intensify.  The pleasure is only increased by the wonder of this revelation.  Is this the answer that I have been seeking?  Can it really be so simple?</P>

<P>But no; the triumph is short-lived, the pleasure is soon swamped by a wave of nausea and a sudden crippling weakness that brings with it another long forgotten emotion – fear.  The realisation dawns on me that I am in fact consuming myself and I rip my wrist away from my teeth with a will strengthened by the impulse for survival.  Within seconds, the wound has healed and I am whole once more; whole perhaps in body, but just as empty and unfulfilled as before.</P>

<P>But now I have a plan.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The following night finds me back on the prowl; a different city, a different crowd and, for once, a different objective.  It is no victim that I seek to choose tonight, it is a partner.  This new direction still unsettles me somewhat.  The idea of relinquishing even a little of my power to another is an unfamiliar one, but my desire is strong enough to conquer the apprehension, or in fact make use of it to heighten my anticipation of the evening’s end.</P>

<P>I notice a young man on the other side of the room regarding me with thinly veiled interest.  As our eyes meet, he raises one elegant eyebrow in a silent challenge and I know I have found the one to lead me to completion of my quest.  A slight inclination of my head is all it takes to get him moving towards the door and I follow, for once placing myself in the hands of someone else.</P>

<P>It is not far to his abode and his impatience is manifested when he crushes me up against the door the moment it closes behind us.  Lips locked together, we wrestle for control of the embrace and, after a moment, I gain the upper hand, not willing to submit to him until I have made my intentions clear.  I take hold of his wrists, forcing his hands down and behind his back, thus pinning him against me and preventing him from breaking free.  He bares his teeth at me and growls deep in his throat before lunging towards my neck.</P>

<P>I skilfully evade his strike and then laugh at him, whispering harshly, &quot;Not yet.&quot;</P>

<P>I turn, taking him with me, moving until it is he that is pressed against the door.  I lean forwards and sink my teeth into his flesh where the neck meets the shoulder.  He struggles for a moment until the pleasure makes itself known and then, when I release his hands, he brings them up to cradle my head and hold me tightly to my endeavour.  His blood is rich and tangy, and I feel his youthful strength flowing into me as I drink.  He is groaning now, his hands clutched in my hair, his body shuddering against me as the pleasure that should be mine courses through him.  I am caught up in the power of his reaction and almost forget my purpose, only pulling away at the last moment before his death.</P>

<P>He is weakened and I lower him slowly to the floor, wondering if I have gone too far and ruined my plan.  But he is still alive, looking up at me with hunger and frustration clear in his eyes.  I smile in the knowledge that I have cheated him of the climax of his pleasure, and now it is time to take my own.</P>

<P>I rip at the skin of my wrist with my teeth and then squeeze the flesh above the cut to force the drops of blood to fall onto his face.  Instinctively, his tongue reaches out to lick them up and his eyes widen at the unfamiliar taste.  I kneel then and offer him my arm.  He takes it in his shaking hands and brings my damaged wrist to his lips, licking delicately at the wound, curious and hesitant at the same time.  I feel the pleasure centre in my body begin to awaken and I urge him on, begging him to take my blood so that I can experience that which has hitherto been the sole possession of my victims.</P>

<P>He gains in confidence and greed, turning his initial teasing caresses of my flesh into a strong and violent ravaging, and my pleasure builds with every mouthful of blood that passes from my body into his.</P>

<P>Suddenly, he goes rigid and starts convulsing.  I fall away from him in shock, wondering what could possibly be happening.  After a few moments, he goes limp and I scream out my frustration as I am left unsatisfied yet again.  Then my despair turns to exultation as he stirs once more and opens his eyes, dead eyes that stare up at me with a familiar hunger, and I realise what it is that I have done.  Is it not the definition of a god – to create a being in one’s own image?  And so, on the night that I have found the answer to my quest, I have also achieved godhood.  It seems a fitting accomplishment.</P>

<P>His lips stretch into a feral grin and I do not stop him as he reaches for my arm and resumes his feast.  This is, after all, what I wanted; to share the experience of my victims.  His strength is clearly returning, just as mine is rapidly diminishing, but I am too lost in the incredible surge of pleasure that is rising through my body to be concerned about that.  It builds and builds until I do not think I can take any more and then the wave breaks and washes over me in an eternal moment of sublime ecstasy.  I hear myself cry out, but it is as if another person in another body is doing so; I am floating somewhere within myself, clinging to this revelation of ultimate fulfilment as the pleasure gradually fades away, leaving me with a wonderful sense of supreme satisfaction.</P>

<P>I collapse to the floor, utterly spent, all my energy draining away, pouring out of me in an unstoppable flood, and I have neither the will nor the strength to attempt to stem its flow.  I manage to open my eyes to see the provider of this moment gazing down at me, his face alight with a satisfaction of his own.  I recognise that expression, remember the feeling that prompts it from the days of my first killings, when simply the act of ending another’s life was more than enough.</P>

<P>In that moment, as the world retreats around me and I fall into the oblivion of death, I realise that once again I have been thwarted.  In giving myself up to the pursuit of the pleasure that is only afforded to the victim, I have paid the ultimate price for the achievement of my goal and, in the process, awarded the final victory to another.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
