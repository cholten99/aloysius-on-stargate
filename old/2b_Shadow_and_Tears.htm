<P>"Why are you still wearing your jacket? It's far too warm down here, don't<BR>
you think?"<BR>
<BR>
It was unseasonably warm beneath the trees of Lothlorien - elven magic,<BR>
Merry surmised - but that was not really why he asked the question. He was<BR>
just trying to get some kind of a reaction from Pippin, who had been silent<BR>
and withdrawn since they had left Moria.<BR>
<BR>
When Pippin responded to his question by mechanically removing his jacket<BR>
but saying nothing, Merry's concern for his friend deepened. He knew Pippin<BR>
was upset about what had happened in Balin's tomb, but as yet their journey into the forest had not afforded them an opportunity to talk about it. Now, they were at leisure in a clearing set aside for their comfort by the elves, but Pippin did not seem to be in the mood for conversation.  He lay down, refusing to meet Merry’s eye.<BR>
<BR>
Ethereal singing floated down from the canopy, a sound full of beautiful<BR>
sorrow, and Merry's eyes were drawn upwards towards the music.<BR>
<BR>
"A lament for Gandalf," Legolas informed them.<BR>
<BR>
Merry was curious despite his worry, and asked, "What do they say about<BR>
him?"<BR>
<BR>
But Legolas would not translate. "I have not the heart to tell you," he<BR>
said, his voice soft and sad. "For me the grief is still too near." With<BR>
that, he wandered away from them into the trees.<BR>
<BR>
Sam started talking about Gandalf's fireworks, but Merry's attention was<BR>
brought back to Pippin, who had covered his face with his arms at the<BR>
mention of Gandalf and rolled over so that his back was to the rest of the<BR>
party.<BR>
<BR>
A moment later, despondent at the inadequacy of his poetry, Sam moved to the<BR>
back of the clearing to sit with Frodo, while Aragorn went to talk to<BR>
Boromir on the other side of the trees. Gimli was fast asleep, leaving<BR>
Merry and Pippin essentially alone.<BR>
<BR>
Merry shifted round to sit next to Pippin and reached out a tentative hand<BR>
to his shoulder.</P>

<P>Pippin flinched away from his touch and muttered, &quot;Leave me alone, Merry.&quot;</P>

<P>Not so long ago, Merry might have taken his friend’s apparent desire for solitude at face value and given up.  But much had changed in both the mind and heart of Meriadoc Brandybuck over the last few weeks.  He had seen the world outside the Shire and it was a dark and frightening place.  He felt very small and alone in the midst of its vastness and he needed Pippin’s companionship, even if Pippin didn’t want his.</P>

<P>They had been friends as long as Merry could remember, never very far from one another and sharing everything in their lives.  However, up until now, the experiences they had shared had always been happy ones; jokes and parties, games and laughter.  At the beginning, even the quest they were on now had seemed like a grand adventure.  But Moria had changed all that; death had touched the Fellowship and had taught Merry that there was a whole new range of emotions he had never before felt.  Fear, sorrow, anger, pain; all had been unleashed on his innocent and unsuspecting heart, leaving him breathless and confused.</P>

<P>Sitting alone, dwelling on his own misery made no sense to Merry, not when Pippin was hurting too.  Sharing things with Pippin had always made them better and he saw no reason why that shouldn’t be true in this situation.  So, instead of drawing back, Merry pulled Pippin up and into his arms, embracing him tightly.  Pippin tensed up, at first rejecting the contact but, when a few moments passed and Merry didn’t let go, he suddenly started hugging Merry back, clutching him with a desperation that showed Pippin felt just as lost as he did.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, Merry!&quot; Pippin wailed.  &quot;Gandalf’s dead, and it’s all my fault!&quot;</P>

<P>With the release of tension came tears, and Pippin wept bitterly in Merry’s arms.  Merry’s heart ached to see his mischievous, carefree playmate so guilt-wracked and inconsolable, and he was at a loss as to what to say to make Pippin feel better.  So, he simply held his friend and murmured soothing words, trying to tell Pippin that he would always be there for him and would love him, no matter what.</P>

<P>Eventually, Pippin cried himself out and fell into a fitful, exhausted sleep, nestled in Merry’s lap.  Merry remained awake, watching over his friend as he slept, not wanting to let him go.</P>

<P>Some time later, soft footsteps made Merry look up to see Aragorn approaching.  The tall ranger’s expression was affectionate and concerned.</P>

<P>&quot;How is he?&quot; Aragorn asked quietly.</P>

<P>&quot;Different,&quot; Merry replied.</P>

<P>Aragorn sighed and crouched next to him, looking into Merry’s face with sorrow in his eyes.</P>

<P>&quot;I wish I could tell you that everything will be alright, Merry,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don’t think you would believe me if I tried.  The world is a hard place and it changes people.  But Gandalf argued for you and Pippin to come along on this quest, so I am convinced you both will have some part to play before all this is over.&quot;  He offered up an encouraging smile.  &quot;Try to get some rest.  We still have a long way to go.&quot;</P>

<P>He left Merry to thoughts that were dark and chaotic.  What other horrors did they still have to face, and would he and Pippin have the strength to overcome them?</P>

<P>Only time would tell.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
