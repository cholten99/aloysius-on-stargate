wormhole gave way to the inevitable forested vista of another alien
planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The sun shone down on the
wealth of greenery that lay before SG-1 as they stood together on the steps of
the Stargate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their surroundings seemed
so tranquil and untouched, it was difficult for Daniel to believe that this
planet was the current base of a Goa’uld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, despite the total lack of activity around the gate, the UAV had
shown that there was a small compound some distance away that was patrolled by
Jaffa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>General Hammond had authorised a
reconnaissance mission to establish what the Goa’uld were doing there, so SG-1
had come to investigate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on his arm, bringing him instantly back to reality.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">  </span>Jack’s words were addressed the whole team but the touch was for
Daniel alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was only brief, and
very discreet, but Daniel drew both strength and affection from it, throwing a
small smile in Jack’s direction as the older man moved off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since this was a covert mission and they
would not be staying overnight, they had brought with them only minimal
supplies and Daniel was glad of the absence of his heavy pack.<span

been impossible with its bulky obstruction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

close behind, Sam coming after the archaeologist, and Teal’c bringing up the
rear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They moved in silence, aware of
the possibility of enemy patrols.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
video playback from the UAV had suggested that the best vantage point from
which to observe the Goa’uld base was a rise of land on the far side of the
compound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This meant they would have to
circle round from the Stargate to come at the base from the opposite direction,
leading them on a long trek through quite dense undergrowth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was hard going and it took them two hours
to reach their destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Eventually,
Jack signalled backwards that they were getting close, warning the rest of his
team to take extra care to be quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The trees opened out onto the top of a ridge, which gave a view of the
enemy base below them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The four took up
positions lying in the long grass, enabling them to look down on the base from
relative concealment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

small clearing, with the forest on three sides and the slope of the ridge on
the fourth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A partially constructed
building in the centre was surrounded by a busy camp of tents and makeshift
shelters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jack spent a long moment
studying the scene through his binoculars before handing them along to Daniel,
who was lying next to him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Recognise
the symbol, Daniel?” he asked softly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Accepting the binoculars, Daniel examined the closest of the visible
Jaffa, but had to admit he couldn’t tell which Goa’uld they served from the
unfamiliar symbol on their foreheads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the first to notice the sudden increase in the level of activity.<span

downwards with the other, whispering, “I think something’s happening.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Three more pairs of eyes followed his gaze
to see a great surge of Jaffa emerge from the central building.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Jaffa split into groups of four or five,
their leaders yelling instructions to get them in formation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once organised, the groups headed rapidly
out from the camp in all directions at a steady jog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

make a try straight for the gate – we don’t want to get trapped here while the
Jaffa carry out extended training exercises or whatever.”<span

as they could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This time, Teal’c led
the way, the others relying on his excellent hearing and tracking skills to
warn them of any enemies nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sure
enough, they had been travelling for about an hour, when Teal’c stopped
suddenly, holding up one hand to signal that he had heard something.<span

back over his shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A split second later, he
raised his hand and the crystal in the centre of his hand device started to
glow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“Good.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Daniel tasted salt and realised that there were tears streaming
unchecked down his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tears for his
parents, for Sha’re, for Sarah, and even for Nick – all combining to fuel his
desperate need to keep Jack alive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
couldn’t lose Jack; he didn’t have enough grief left to cope with another
loss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So Jack would just have to live.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>With renewed resolve, he got back to his
feet and ran to the airlock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
shifting of the ship had pulled that end of it out of the swamp so the water
was no longer coming in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Spotting some
skeletal trees off to one side, Daniel climbed out of the ship and lowered
himself gradually down into the water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It reached his thighs before his feet hit the bottom, and the last few
inches were made up of thick mud, making his progress towards the vegetation
painfully slow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When he reached the
trees, he selected an appropriate branch and set to work with his knife, sawing
at the wood with a violence borne out of desperation.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It wasn’t long before he was making his laboured way back to the
ship with his prize.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>By the time he arrived at the doors to
the cargo area once more, Daniel was totally exhausted, covered in mud and
nearing breaking point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He allowed
himself a brief moment to steady his breathing and try to calm his mind before
setting the branch between the doors as a lever and pulling with all his
strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The doors gave a hideous
screech and slowly edged open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>As soon as the gap was wide enough,
Daniel launched himself through it and raced to Jack’s side.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the near total darkness, he sought out
his lover’s neck with trembling fingers and nearly cried with relief when he
found a weak but steady pulse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pulling
Jack to him, Daniel hugged him fiercely before picking him up and preparing to
carry him to the gate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The next half hour was a blur of freezing
water, complaining muscles and evil mud that sucked at Daniel’s feet with every
step he took.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Stargate taunted him
from its lofty position atop the hill, always in sight but never seeming to get
any nearer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, though, he made it
to the DHD and entered the address to Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Without putting Jack down, Daniel transmitted the iris code with the GDO
that was still strapped to his wrist and stepped into the event horizon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The swirling blue spiral of the wormhole
abruptly resolved itself into the solid greyness of the gate room at the
SGC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel staggered slightly on the
ramp as the disorientation and intense cold of gate travel combined with his
fatigue and emotional turmoil caused a wave of dizziness to course through
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He heard shouting and white-clad
figures converged on him from all sides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He felt Jack’s dead weight being lifted from him and replaced by the
soft warmth of a blanket, which somebody wrapped around his bare shoulders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Janet’s voice cut through the
confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Daniel, look at me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Are you alright?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Daniel’s mind cleared slightly and he
managed to focus on her face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There’s
nothing wrong with me,” he told her impatiently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>“Help Jack!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Then Sam was at his side, one arm snaking
around his waist in a surreptitious hug.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“Daniel – god, you’re freezing!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looks like you had a rough trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We’ve been really worried about you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Daniel’s gaze was following the gurney
that was being rushed out of the gate room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“Jack…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“The Colonel’s in good hands, Daniel,”
Sam assured him, guiding him down the ramp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“Come on, let’s get you to the infirmary.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
</span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">     </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Daniel sat at Jack’s bedside, watching
the steady rise and fall of his lover’s chest intently.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It had been some hours since Janet had
declared Jack out of danger and finally allowed Daniel to take up watch next to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since then, Daniel had simply sat
in the infirmary, unmoving, watching Jack breathe.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was amazing how the events of one day could make someone so
incredibly aware of such a small and generally unnoticed movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Both his hands clasping one of Jack’s,
his cheek pressed gently into Jack’s palm, Daniel fixed his eyes steadily on
Jack’s heavily bandaged torso and drank in the evidence of life flowing through
the still body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Jack’s fingers twitched in Daniel’s grasp
and the tenor of his breathing changed, alerting Daniel to the fact that he was
waking up before his eyelids fluttered and slowly opened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dark, sleepy eyes searched out Daniel’s face
and previously slack lips curved upwards into a gentle smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“Hey,” Jack whispered.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“What’s the time?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“Hey yourself,” Daniel replied softly, a
surge of relief choking his words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“About 4am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You should be
asleep.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“So should you.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jack’s tone was tender.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“What are you still doing here?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In response, Daniel buried his face in
Jack’s palm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Silly question,” he
murmured shakily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Jack shifted his hand slightly and gently
brushed sudden tears from Daniel’s cheek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“Hey,” he said again, “what’s the matter?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Daniel remained silent for a long moment,
gazing down at Jack’s concerned expression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Finally, he said, “I don’t think I can do this any more.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>“Do what?” Jack prompted lightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>One of Daniel’s hands broke away briefly
to gesture around the room before returning to its closely guarded possession
of Jack’s forearm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“This,” he
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Going offworld and always being
afraid something like this is going to happen to you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Watching you suffer and not being able to do anything about
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Waiting for you to wake up and
knowing that if you don’t it’ll be largely my fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It’s too hard, Jack – I don’t think I can do it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Unexpectedly, Jack’s smile widened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Ah, so finally you get a little taste of
what it’s like to be me,” he teased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then he sobered and held Daniel’s anguished gaze steadily.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You think you wouldn’t still feel all of
that if you quit the team and stayed behind here all the time while I went
offworld with somebody else to watch my back?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Trust me, Daniel, not being there would be far worse, and you know I’m not
going to retire from the SGC just because you’re worried I’m going to get
hurt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel, I’m alive today because
you were with me on that ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I know
it’s hard – you think I don’t worry just as much about you when we’re on a
mission?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But I need you out there,
Daniel, with me, not stuck here pretending you don’t want to be a part of what
we do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whatever happens to us out
there, it’s better if we face it together, okay?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Wordlessly, Daniel nodded, and Jack
smiled again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, quit worrying so much, hero, and let me
get some more sleep.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With that, he
resolutely reclaimed his hand from Daniel’s jealous grasp, shifted slightly in
the bed in an effort to get more comfortable, and then closed his eyes again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Daniel sat back in his chair, and settled
down once more to watch his lover sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-GB>THE END</span></p>
