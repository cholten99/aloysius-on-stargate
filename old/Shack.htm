<P>Sirius bared his teeth and growled across the room.  Remus snarled back, his red eyes illuminated by a baleful glow.  They circled one another warily, Remus looking for an opening to attack, while Sirius tried to stay between the werewolf and the door.  It was always worst just before the dawn, as if the wolf part of Remus grew frustrated with its imprisonment and redoubled its efforts to escape the shack and rampage through Hogsmeade.</P>

<P>Sirius’ sharpened senses took note of the way Remus’ muscles were tensing, and he leapt forwards just before the werewolf launched his attack.  He bowled Remus to the ground and fastened his teeth on the point where the werewolf’s head met his shoulders, exerting enough pressure to give the werewolf pause but very careful not to break the skin.  They tussled for a moment, and then Sirius felt the form beneath him suddenly begin to jerk and shudder.  He released the werewolf’s neck but kept him pinned with his paws, gazing down in compassion as the transformation began to take place.</P>

<P>As Remus’ fur receded and was replaced by bruised skin, and his lupine limbs gradually turned back into human arms and legs, Sirius triggered his own transformation back from dog to man.  Within moments, they were both human again, Remus curled in a ball on the floor, with Sirius wrapped around him, holding him close as he trembled from the aftereffects of the night.</P>

<P>&quot;Si?&quot; Remus’ hoarse voice asked hesitantly.</P>

<P>Sirius murmured reassuringly in his friend’s ear.  &quot;It’s alright, Moony, I’m here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t let go,&quot; came the familiar plea, and Sirius tightened his grip around Remus’ torso, crushing his friend to his chest as Remus’ shudders gradually subsided.</P>

<P>Remus always got like this after he changed back.  The confines of Sirius’ strong embrace made him feel safe, and reassured him that the beast had been quelled for another month and was not about to burst forth once more.  Sirius hoped he would always be there to calm Remus’ fears.</P>
