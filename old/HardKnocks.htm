continued, “Ah!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is a preliminary
survey only, Daniel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We report back on
our initial findings and then a decision will be made as to whether we log the

split up, as per Jack’s instructions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It had been a while now since Daniel had managed to get even a single
word of protest out in these situations before being stomped on, and he only
really tried out of habit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Jack had reminded
him more than once during their early missions, SG-1 was a first contact team
and it would be up to others to follow up their work if it was deemed
worthwhile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel had long since given
up his preference for extended study, except for the occasional consultancy for
a different team, in favour of the excitement of missions with SG-1.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

though, it wasn’t the excitement that kept him where he was.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The real reason he stayed with SG-1 was the
man now walking at his side across an alien landscape.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The hard-headed, stubborn, narrow-minded,
completely infuriating Air Force colonel to whom Daniel willingly entrusted his
life on a daily basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was also the
strong, kind-hearted, soul-sore and downright sexy man to whom Daniel had
unwillingly surrendered his heart some months before.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Ever since all possibility of being reunited with Sha’re had been
irrevocably destroyed by Teal’c’s staff weapon blast, Daniel had gradually allowed
the extent of his true feelings for Jack to surface in his heart and mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their object was intentionally oblivious,
however, since Daniel was sure Jack could never feel the same way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was long accustomed to being alone,
though, and contented himself with the friendship that had existed between them
now for several years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>As they walked in companionable silence,
Daniel took a moment to appreciate the chance to spend some time with Jack
without the danger of imminent attack or nasty surprises.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The telemetry sent back from P3R-274 by the UAV
had shown no signs of current habitation anywhere near the gate, which was
presumably why Jack had felt comfortable splitting the team.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel knew Jack wasn’t overly happy with
their current assignment, since he always seemed to feel somewhat superfluous
on purely scientific missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There
was also the fact that he was completely uninterested in the things that
fascinated Sam and Daniel about the planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It gratified Daniel that Jack had chosen to accompany him rather than
going off with Sam to collect the ubiquitous soil samples, making him think
that perhaps Jack did have slightly more interest in what Daniel was doing
here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This impression was unexpectedly
corroborated when Jack suddenly broke the silence with a question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that means we have to traipse halfway across this boring planet to take a look
at them, Daniel?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>It wasn’t exactly the most enthusiastic of
questions, but Daniel never needed much encouragement to talk about his
passion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He spent the rest of the
hour-long walk happily detailing to Jack precisely why he didn’t think the
strange rock formation he’d spotted on the UAV’s video footage was
natural.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He expounded on his theories
of what this might mean about the history of the planet’s possible inhabitants,
cross-referencing with what he knew of Earth cultures that build similar
structures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time they arrived at
their destination, Jack seemed to be expecting some amazing feat of structural
engineering, and his reaction to the waist-high piles of pebbles they found
made Daniel smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

muttering about rock-obsessed geeks under his breath, and left Daniel to his
investigations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The archaeologist
ignored him, instantly engrossed in what he was doing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Circling the stones slowly, he recorded them
from every angle with his compact video camera.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The first thing that had caught his interest was the fact that
they were several shades lighter than the rocks of the surrounding area,
suggesting that they had been moved there from elsewhere.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other major giveaway was that they were
all perfectly smooth and had been arranged in piles of decreasing size, laid
out in a rough oval shape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>Once he had finished filming, Daniel
approached one of the piles that had collapsed, spilling its stones into the
centre of the oval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the care and
reverence borne out of many years handling rare and fragile artefacts, he began
to pick up the rocks and replace them on the appropriate pile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As he reached to collect some of the smaller
stones from where they had scattered, Daniel’s hand trailed through the dust
and he noticed some kind of marking on the ground beneath.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Scraping away some more of the debris, he
began to uncover a smooth platform that had a pattern engraved on its surface.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel grabbed his pack and quickly pulled
out the set of brushes he had brought with him from Earth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Excitedly, he selected the largest one and
started sweeping the dust aside to reveal more of the carving.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time he was done, he was kneeling on
a large oval-shaped slab of rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
was cut in two across the shortest section, with the top part separated further
into triangles by deep lines that extended out to the surrounding piles of
stones, while the bottom half had a collection of strange symbols etched into
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

need to share his discovery, so he stood up and called out to Jack, who

being brought up short as he saw what lay at Daniel’s feet.<span

argument now,” he continued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“What does
it mean?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grinning up at his friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then he took
a couple of steps back and looked down at the symbols intently.<span

about one of them and knelt back down to take a closer look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The younger man reached out
and pressed down on one part of the rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A small section sank down underneath his fingers, accompanied by a deep
rumbling noise and a slight vibration in the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Daniel sat back in surprise, and the section of stone came back
up as he released it, putting an end to the noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

forestall any further comments, not wanting his train of thought to be
interrupted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was glancing around the
area, hoping to spot something that would tell him the next step.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His eyes alighted on a fairly large rock
that sat on its own slightly outside the oval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>With a sudden inspiration, Daniel reached out and hefted the rock over
to where he was kneeling and thumped it down on the symbol.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The section of stone sank once more and this
time was held down by the weight of the rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The rumbling began again and, as the two men watched, the triangular
sections of the slab shifted down as well and slowly slid backwards to reveal a
staircase leading down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

climb a nearby rise of land, and then he heard him reporting briefly to their
other team members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unable to resist
what he saw as an open invitation, Daniel brought out his flashlight, flicked
it on and started to descend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He heard
