<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The station was busy. 
Jeff looked at his watch and sighed.  It was always busy at this time
of day.  He looked out over the sea of people who would be attempting
to cram themselves onto the next train with him, at a time in the
morning when he would really rather still have been in bed.  As the
train pulled in to the platform, the usual crush of commuters
gathered at each set of doors.  Frustrated and irritable, Jeff
jostled for position and, as the doors slid open, he shoved a young
woman out of his way in order to ensure his place on the train.  The
doors closed again behind him and the vehicle jolted into motion, but
Jeff was no longer thinking about his journey.  He was staring down
in horror at the crystal embedded in the back of his hand, which had
just changed from green to red.   
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Oblivious to the
equally horrified looks of his fellow passengers, Jeff stumbled off
the train at the next station and stood frozen on the platform. 
Getting to work was now the least of his worries.  The red light of
the crystal taunted him with the knowledge that he had just damned
his immortal soul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">* * *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The crystals had turned
up in general circulation about half a century before.  Certainly,
Jeff had had one all his life, as had most of the people he knew. 
They were the result of an unexpected breakthrough in the study of
Kirlian auras, a kind of glow given off by all living creatures. 
Scientists had been examining the changes in the auras throughout
various creatures' lives, focusing particularly <FONT COLOR="#000000">on
the differences wrought by the creatures' deaths.  </FONT>Jeff wasn't
clear on the details &ndash; he'd never been much good at science &ndash;
but he knew what<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">it
</FONT>meant for people in general.  The research had determined that
souls really existed and went to one of two places after the death of
the mortal body &ndash; one good, one bad.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The scientists had
subsequently figured out a way to measure the state of a person's
Kirlian aura, and thus determine where the soul would be bound if the
body died at any particular moment.  Hence the crystals &ndash; green
for good and red for bad.</P>
<P CLASS="list-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Of course, the whole
world had gone mad when the news broke.  The ramifications of the
aura research stretched to every aspect of human existence.  It prove
the presence of some kind of supreme being who had judg<FONT COLOR="#000000">e</FONT>mental
control over the fate of every human soul.  However, followers of
every known religion exhibited both green and red crystals, which
disproved any theory that you had to worship a particular god in
order to gain your reward in the afterlife.  Essentially, it was the
end of organised religion, though there were a great many who
resisted giving up the beliefs they had relied upon for so long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Also, rather
inevitably, a new religion had sprung up around what little was known
about the being in question.  The fact that no firm conclusions could
be reached about the moral or ethical system used by the judging
entity didn't seem to bother its followers.  In fact, one of their
main rules was that they didn't wear crystals.  They preferred to
leave the decision of their guilt or innocence entirely up to their
deity, claiming they had no right<FONT COLOR="#000000"> to </FONT>actively
interfere with the process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The other main group of
non-crystal-wearing people actually went to the other extreme,
choosing not to be subject to the will of an overseeing force.  They
often wore garments or displayed bumper stickers with the slogan
&ldquo;Judg<FONT COLOR="#ff9900">e</FONT>ment Free&rdquo;, and
generally considered themselves superior to the 'crystal slaves', as
they referred to those who bore them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Jeff was one of the
vast majority, taken by his parents to an Implantation Centre at the
age of one to have a crystal embedded in the back of his hand.  It
wasn't compulsory, but the number of people who chose not to have
their children implanted was few, reduced further by those who
subsequently opted to receive a crystal as an adult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Jeff had never
considered having his crystal removed.  In fact, he'd never even
given the thing much thought &ndash; until today.  He wasn't a bad
guy.  Sure, he laughed at offensive jokes, shouted at tele-marketers
when they called him at home, threw water at the next door
neighbour's cat if it got into his garden &ndash; but he'd never done
anything actually evil.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That was the biggest
problem with the crystals.  There was no way to tell where you were
on the scale or how each individual action affected it.  The crystal
was either green or it was red; there were no shades in between.  The
worst thing was that motivation seemed to be taken into account by
whoever was keeping the tally.  All the research said that good deeds
undertaken with the intention of turning the crystal back to green
after it had turned red had no effect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Initially, when the
crystals had come out, crime rates had plummet<FONT COLOR="#000000">t</FONT>ed
as everyone tried to ensure that their crystal stayed green.  They
had gradually risen again, though, as human nature reasserted itself,
and some of those whose crystals had turned red gave up trying to
switch them back and just decided to do whatever they wanted, since
they were damned anyway.  <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">There was
even a sub-culture of red crystal bearers who proclaimed their status
proudly, wearing t-shirts with slogans like &ldquo;Judged and found
wanting&rdquo; or &ldquo;Green doesn't go with this outfit&rdquo;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><B>* * *</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="list-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Jeff
was not prepared to give in to the judgement staring him in the face.
 He couldn't believe that his mistakes and indiscretions had really
amounted to enough sin to condemn his soul to eternal torment.  There
had to have been some kind of mistake.  </SPAN>Nobody really knew how
the crystals worked; perhaps his had malfunctioned in some way.  That
had to be it; something had gone wrong with it and he'd have to go
and get it fixed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now that a reasonable
explanation and easy solution had presented themselves, Jeff was
galvanised into action.  He ran from the station platform to find the
correct trainline to take him out of the city, oblivious to the fact
that he shoved several more people out of his path on the way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Implantation Centre
was on an industrial estate on the outskirts of town.  Jeff was not
familiar with the area, having had no need to go there since his own
implantation at the age of one.  He was surprised to discover that
the entire site was surrounded by a twenty-foot high fence, and the
only entrance sported a formidable security checkpoint.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He strode up and
presented himself to the bored-looking guard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The man barely glanced
at him before saying dismissively, &ldquo;Implantations are daily
between 2pm and 3pm.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I'm not here for
an implantation,&rdquo; Jeff replied.  &ldquo;I need to see someone
about my crystal.  It's malfunctioning &ndash; look!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He thrust his hand,
with the crystal still sporting its baleful red glow, into the
guard's face.  The guard didn't look any more interested.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Only went red
today, right?&rdquo; he guessed.  At Jeff's nod, he continued, &ldquo;Go
buy your mother some flowers or something.  You'll be green again by
bedtime.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A voice deep in the
back of Jeff's mind told him it wasn't nearly that simple.  How could
you become a good person without doing it deliberately?  Was there
really such a thing as a selfless act?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, he still
wasn't prepared to accept that the crystal's judgement was accurate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;There's been a
mistake!&rdquo; he protested.  &ldquo;I'm not a bad guy!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The guard sighed.  &ldquo;I
get ten like you here every day,&rdquo; he said wearily.  &ldquo;Get
lost, mate.  You're wasting your time.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As Jeff turned away, to
head dejectedly back towards the station, he noticed that the guard
was wearing gloves.  He thought about all the scientists, separated
from him by more than just walls of glass and steel.  He wondered
what colour their crystals were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">THE END</P>
