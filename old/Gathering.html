	<td colspan=13 rowspan=1 width=586><span style="font-size:14">The first thing that struck me when we arrived was the scale of the thing.&nbsp; Dave had told me that up to 4000 people attend, but I hadn’t really thought about what this meant.&nbsp; The amount of organisation that must go into the event is phenomenal – there are so many people who take it incredibly seriously, and they are the ones that make it so great for the rest of us.&nbsp; There are ten factions (Dragons, Tarantulas, Unicorns, Gryphons, Lions, Bears, Harts, Vipers, Wolves and Jackals), each of which has their own campsite, with a huge marketplace in the centre, which had stalls selling clothes, weapons, accessories, etc.&nbsp; There was an area set aside for the guilds (Healers, Archers, Bards, Mages, etc) where you could sign up your character for extra duties and pick up your spell cards and suchlike.&nbsp; Then there was the Ritual Circle, which was set up in a large tent with vines all over it.&nbsp; This is where ritualists gathered to perform rites, involving much chanting and prancing about and also the possibility of horrible death (demons escape from the void if rituals go on for too long, apparently).&nbsp; Lastly, there was the Transport Circle, marked out by giant red and white toadstools.&nbsp; This is where people (and monsters) would appear in game if they had travelled to the Gathering from far away.</span></td>

	<td colspan=11 rowspan=1 width=584><span style="font-size:14">Okay, so maybe I’d better explain some background, plot and the rules that govern this other world into which I had stepped.&nbsp; The idea is that all ten factions have gathered together in one place to aid peaceful relations through interaction and diplomacy.&nbsp; However, since the majority of the people who go mostly want to hit things with latex weapons, this is rarely the outcome.</span></td>

	<td colspan=10 rowspan=1 width=582><span style="font-size:14">The friends of Dave who attend every year (and are also active at other events in between) are attached to the Harts faction, so this is where we also went.&nbsp; The Harts are made up of various houses, of which the one run by Dave’s friend, Sean, is called House Grimear.&nbsp; Sean plays Dr Alexander Fairfax, the steward of the house, and his three sons (Chris, Matt and Will) play House Grimear guardsmen.&nbsp; They had brought several friends with them, so we had plenty of soldiers around, along with Jim, who originally played an orc but was killed early on and returned as a human cleric, and his girlfriend Evie, who played a Cathayan advisor to Her Serene Highness, Princess Allegra.&nbsp; This latter character is played by Sean’s girlfriend, Amy; she is the Princess of Rus, who has fled her homeland and sought refuge with House Grimear.&nbsp; Dave and I played her cousins, Duke Alexi and Duchess Natalia Romanov.&nbsp; Initially, we were there on behalf of her father, the Tsar, to find out how she was getting on, but the plot grew much more complicated very rapidly.&nbsp; There were also the Flight characters, bird fey with fantastic masks, who speak with irritatingly contagious screwy grammar.</span></td>
