Blond on top and sporting his habitual off-screen goatee, there was no way he could be mistaken for the conservative Major Davis, especially once he started talking!<br><br>He remarked at one point that Davis has never actually gone through the Stargate, and rectified that situation by climbing through the mini one that stood at the back of the stage.<br><br>The best story from Colin's Friday talk came in response to a question about what it was like coming onto such a close-knit as a guest actor for the first time:<br><br>He said his first scene involved a long single shot that worked down a line of characters in the control room, with Colin right at the end.&nbsp; He apparently only had a really simple line to say, but just kept messing it up.&nbsp; On about the fifth take, after he'd screwed it up yet again, Peter DeLuise's voice wafted up from way behind the camera with the encouraging words, &quot;Who did you have to fuck to get this job?&quot;<br><br>Colin also combined a response to the news that he is known on the net as 'Major Cutie-pie Davis' with an anecdote about his new puppy pooping in his shoes - in the voice of the dog: &quot;Let's see you be Major Cutie-pie wearing those!&quot;<br><br>He was funny, energetic, friendly and very entertaining, making a great start to the day.<br><br>The next line up consisted of Dan Shea (Sgt Siler/Sutnt Co-ordinator), Michael Greenberg (Executive Producer) and David Sinclair (Props Master) and it was an interesting.&nbsp; I have to say I didn't warm to Mr Greenberg - he didn't really get into the spirit of things and actually looked a bit uncomfortable.&nbsp; Dan Shea was a great reaction to that - outspoken, direct and really funny.&nbsp; He actually kept pressing Michael to elaborate on his answers, and told some great stunt anecdotes.&nbsp; He also said that Richard Dean Anderson had banned Sgt Siler's giant wrench because it was stealing his close-ups!&nbsp; David Sinclair didn't get to say much because the other two got most of the questions, but he was rather sweet when he did speak.&nbsp; He told a great story about how he was rummaging around in the props warehouse and suddenly Michael Shanks' head fell on him!<br><br>The techie guys came next - four special effects guys from Rainmaker.&nbsp; Bruce Woloshym fielded nealry all of the questions and it was quite interesting.&nbsp; The best thing he said was that occasionally they'll get the rough cut of an episode and there'll be section that are just a blank screen with a line of text aloing the bottom that says, &quot;put spectacular effect here&quot;!&nbsp; He also pointed out that one of the hardest things to do is a 'puddle pass', which is when the characters walk through the event horizon - there are loads of these all over the place and we're so used to them by now that we don't really look at them as special effects, but the puddle is one of the biggest parts of the effects process.<br><br>Next up were Dougie Arthurs and David Palffy, who were now familiar from the party the night before, with the addition of Steve Makaj (Colonel Makepeace).&nbsp; To begin with, no questions were forthcoming (which much be fairly excrutiating for the guests) so, in true Dougie style, Dougit descended into the audience with his microphone to encourage us.<br><br>Official proceedings ended on a high with a solo appearance from Jay Acavone (Major Kawalsky), who was hilarious.&nbsp; He bemoaned the fact that he always dies in everything he's in, usually before the opening credits, and told the story of his character's death in his most recent movie, S.W.A.T.&nbsp; He played a pilot who's plane crashed, but he kept moving as they stretchered him out of the scene.&nbsp; Eventually the executive producer came over to ask him why he was moving and he replied, &quot;I wasnt to be in the sequel!&quot;&nbsp; This was relayed to the director, who yelled back, &quot;Tell him tough shit - he's dead!&quot;<br><br>In between times, I had to keep rushing off for mad rehearsals of the skits in the lobby, which were progressing with mixed success.&nbsp; Poor Mel was practically tearing her hair out trying to get us all to take it seriously, but eventually she released us to go and get dinner, so Ina and I decided to try the Cronos restaurant across the road as our Stargate-related activity of the day.&nbsp; Trusting our dinner to a dead System Lord turned out not to be such a good plan, since they messed up my order and my pizza didn't arrive until five minutes after I was meant to be at the skits dress rehearsal.&nbsp; So, I got them to box it up and dashed back tot he hotel to get changed.<br><br>The dress rehearsal went pretty well, but my nervousness wasn't helped by the fact that Dougies turned up partway through in preparation for judging the costume competition.&nbsp; I was not looking forward to performing as Heru'ur with the original sitting in the audience.&nbsp; However, it was too good a Gatecon anecdote to give up so, when it looked as though Dougie was going to leave before the skits started, I marched right over to him, indicated the 'Heru'ur' sign around my neck and said, &quot;You're not going to stay to watch me playing you?&quot;&nbsp; He was a bit stunned, but he sat right back down and watched the whole thing.&nbsp; I couldn't see the audience when I was on stage but I was later told that he laughed a lot during my scene.<br><br>The whole experience was insane, but I blame the fact that I shook throughout entirely on not having eaten all day...&nbsp; By the time the skits were over, I was a total wreck, so Terry and I skipped the first charity auction in favour of finding food.&nbsp; We continued exchanging life stories in the bar till late, there was much hysterical giggling on my part and I actually fell off my bed three times during the course of the evening - twice before I'd even started drinking!&nbsp; Overexcitement and convention madness make quite a powerful combination...</span></font></td>
