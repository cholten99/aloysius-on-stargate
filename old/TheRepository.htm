mode. Even without listening to what he was saying, Jack could tell by the
animated way in which he kept gesturing at the screen behind him. He was
enthusing about the video playback of some probe telemetry he had spent all
afternoon analysing. The planet it had come from, designated P4X-725, was one
of the ones Jack himself had entered into the computer while the knowledge of
the Ancients was clogging up his brain. It still gave Jack a headache to think
about that, but Daniel had been adamant ever since that those planets would be
more likely to lead to significant discoveries than the ones from the Abydos
cartouche, since they were unknown to the Goa-uld. This meant that they would
be home to alien species rather than the descendants of humans, aliens who
might have been allied with the Ancients.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

bugs, I hope?” he asked, and received a look from Teal’c that suggested the
Jaffa would rather not have been reminded of that particular experience.
General Hammond was also regarding him somewhat askance. “All I’m saying,” he
elaborated hastily, “is that apparently deserted cities have been known to hide
nasty surprises. I mean, people don’t just up and vanish without good reason.”
Jack gestured at the video footage being projected onto the large screen behind
Daniel. “There’s no bomb damage or evidence of attack. Where did all the
inhabitants go?”</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>

stipulated, “but we’d have to go to the planet to have any hope of answering
that question. The atmosphere is perfectly breathable, and there’s no obvious
threat so the risk seems fairly low. And the possibility of finding something
worthwhile is good; the size and architecture of the buildings suggest a
society at least on a level with our own, and there’s no telling what kind of
technology we might find inside them.”</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

it highlighted the fact that he wasn’t military, so Jack decided to go and find
him. He took the elevator up to the level on which Daniel’s office was
situated, and found the door closed. After rapping on it twice with his
knuckles, he opened it to discover Daniel slumped over his desk, asleep. There
were various books scattered around him and the screen saver on his computer

minutes later, all four member of SG-1 were assembled in the embarkation room,

the gate spun round in front of them. Just as the last chevron engaged and the

the wormhole, Daniel yawned widely, then muttered, “Sorry,” when Jack threw him
a dirty look. They strode up the ramp together and passed through the event

of the planet they got was one of dazzling brightness. The late afternoon sun
was shining directly at the gate and thus into their eyes. Pulling out their
sunglasses, they all trooped down the steps to look around. The stargate was
situated in the exact centre of a large plaza, with patterned paving spread out
all around it. There were various buildings of different designs along each
side of the open area, with a number of streets heading off into the city in
every direction.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>

look inside there,” Daniel replied, pointing at the structure that faced the
gate head on. It was certainly an impressive building, one of the largest, with
columns lined along the top of the steps that ran around its base. They made
their way across the plaza and climbed up to a pair of massive double doors
that opened with a smoothness and ease that belied their size.</span><span

astounding sight that lay before them. The hall stretched out at least two
hundred metres and up several storeys to a series of glass-roofed domes. The
sunlight poured in from outside and reflected off sparkling walls that looked like
marble, white with veins of purple and green. There were spiral staircases that
led up to walkways running the length and breadth of the room on several
levels, and the vast space of the ground floor was interspersed with shelving
units. Every vertical surface was lined with books.</span><span

Carter; even after all the time they’d known him, they were still convinced

his memory. He shook his head to try to dispel the sensation, then pulled over
his most recent journal, picking up a pen as he did so, with the intention of
recording what he could remember of SG-1’s latest mission. Resting the nib on
the first line of a clean page, he formulated the first sentence of his account
in his head, then was suddenly brought up short when he couldn’t seem to
transfer the thoughts into written words. He knew what he wanted to say, but
couldn’t remember how to write it down. Unable to understand what was going on,
Daniel turned back to the last entry and stared numbly down at his own
handwriting. The words on the page appeared to be nothing more than
incomprehensible squiggles; it was as if they were written in a language
completely unknown to him. Stunned, he rifled back through the book, but none

inside the doorway, she caught sight of Daniel himself, sitting on the floor in
