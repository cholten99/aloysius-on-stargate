<P>It was a very subdued band of wizards who returned to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place after the showdown with Voldemort at the Ministry of Magic.  Tonks had been rushed to St Mungo’s, but Mad-Eye Moody had insisted he wasn’t in need of medical attention, and so traipsed into the dingy hallway along with Kingsley and Lupin.</P>

<P>Despite the fact that they were making very little noise, the portrait of Mrs Black had clearly been awaiting their return, as she was already awake.  She started up her usual tirade as soon as they opened the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Filthy traitors!&quot; she shrieked.  &quot;How can that good-for-nothing Mudblood-lover son of mine dare to let you contaminate this house - ?&quot;</P>

<P>Kingsley and Moody reached automatically for the edges of the drapes to cover her up, but they were pushed aside by a white-faced, trembling Lupin, who squared up to the portrait with fury in his eyes.  When he spoke, his voice was low but full of venom.</P>

<P>&quot;No doubt you will be delighted to hear that your son is dead.  You can badmouth the rest of us all you like, but if you malign him in my hearing again, I will not rest until I have found a way to destroy you.&quot;</P>

<P>The image in the portrait stared at him for a moment, then shut her mouth with a snap of her teeth and retreated slightly within her frame.  Moody’s magical eye swivelled to look at Lupin in amazement, but he simply turned on his heel and disappeared up the stairs.</P>

<P>Moody and Kingsley exchanged a concerned glance but, before either of them could say anything, the door behind them flew open to admit Arther and Molly Weasley.</P>

<P>&quot;We heard there was an incident at the Minstry involving Harry and You-Know-Who!&quot; Molly cried.  &quot;Is Harry alright?  What happened?  Where are the others?&quot;</P>

<P>Moody laid a hand on Molly’s arm in an attempt to calm her.  &quot;Dumbledore took Harry and the other youngsters back to Hogwarts.  They’re all fine,&quot; he added quickly as he saw the panic rising in her eyes.</P>

<P>&quot;Come on into the kitchen, both of you, and we’ll tell you everything,&quot; Kingsley said.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Half an hour later, the tale was told and a pall of grief hung over the kitchen.</P>

<P>&quot;Poor Harry!&quot; Arthur exclaimed.  &quot;Shouldn’t somebody be with him?&quot;</P>

<P>Moody harrumphed.  &quot;Dumbledore whisked him straight back to school,&quot; he said.  &quot;Safest place for him.  The Headmaster and Minerva will be watching out for him, and he’s got all his friends there.  Best to let him finish term, I say.&quot;</P>

<P>Molly looked up from where she’d been studying the tabletop, and glanced around the room as if only just noticing something.</P>

<P>&quot;Where’s Remus?&quot; she asked, with obvious concern.</P>

<P>&quot;Upstairs somewhere,&quot; Kingsley told her.  &quot;He lost it with Mrs Black out in the hall when we got back and then vanished.&quot;</P>

<P>Molly rose.  &quot;I’d better go and check if he’s alright,&quot; she said.</P>

<P>The others nodded wearily but made no comment as she left the room.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Molly tiptoed through the hall, but her stealth was unnecessary as Mrs Black merely stared at her balefully from deep within the portrait as she passed.  She made her way up the stairs to the room Sirius had been using, and quietly opened the door.  It was dark inside, but the light from the landing revealed the huddled form of Lupin sitting on the floor beside the big double bed.  He had his knees drawn up to his chest and his face was hidden.</P>

<P>Molly crossed the room and knelt down beside him, laying a hand on his arm.</P>

<P>&quot;Remus?&quot; she said softly.</P>

<P>He slowly raised his head to reveal tearstains on his grief-ravaged face.  He stared at Molly, his eyes filled with bewildered anger.</P>

<P>&quot;How could he leave me?&quot; he whispered in a voice hoarse with emotion.  &quot;How could he leave me alone again?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, Remus,&quot; Molly said, her own voice breaking as she saw his pain.</P>

<P>&quot;I’d only just got him back,&quot; Lupin continued.  &quot;I thought we’d have time – to make up for all we’d lost…&quot;  The anger shone forth more strongly and there was a hard edge to Lupin’s words as he went on.  &quot;He never listened to me!  He never trusted me!  All those years ago, he went after Peter on his own without telling me, and he ended up in Azkaban, branded a murderer.  And then, tonight, I told him I’d take care of everything, I begged him to stay here, but he insisted on going with us.  Why wouldn’t he listen to me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Harry needed him,&quot; Molly pointed out gently. &quot;He wasn’t going to sit idly by doing nothing when Harry needed him.&quot;</P>

<P>Lupin’s gaze bored into her, his expression one of unashamed anguish.  &quot;I needed him too!&quot; he cried.</P>

<P>Molly shifted her position and pulled the distraught Lupin into her arms.  She rocked him as if he was a child, stroking his hair with one hand as she held him tight with the other.</P>

<P>&quot;I know, I know,&quot; she soothed, feeling utterly useless.</P>

<P>&quot;You don’t understand,&quot; he moaned.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, dear, I do,&quot; Molly told him matter-of-factly.</P>

<P>He pulled away from her suddenly and searched her face.  &quot;You – you knew?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; she said, smiling at him tenderly and reaching up to brush a lock of hair out of his eyes.  &quot;You think I didn’t realise why he was so miserable every time you left on Order business, and why he perked up again as soon as you got back?  And the fact that your bed was never slept in when I went in to change the sheets was a bit of a clue as well.&quot;</P>

<P>Lupin managed to look a little sheepish.  &quot;I suppose we weren’t very subtle about it,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;It was just that we had so little time together; we didn’t want to waste it being careful.  I just can’t believe he’s really gone, Molly.&quot;  He ran his fingers through his hair.  &quot;The first time, it wasn’t so bad, though of course the situation was awful.  James was dead and I thought Peter was too, and it looked like Sirius was responsible.  We’d drifted apart around the time Harry was born so when Sirius got dragged off to Azkaban, it was easy for me to hate him.  I feel terrible about it now, but that was what got me through the loneliness.  When I found out he was innocent, it was both the best and worst moment of my life; I had Sirius back, but we’d lost so much time and there was so much guilt between us.  We were just getting back to how things used to be, and now – I’m not sure I can do it, Molly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do what,&quot; she asked.</P>

<P>Lupin looked at her levelly.  &quot;Go on without him.&quot;</P>

<P>Molly gasped.  &quot;Of course you can, Remus!&quot; she exclaimed, but his eyes told her how serious he was.  &quot;The Order needs you more than ever now You-Know-Who has finally shown his hand.  Sirius wouldn’t want you to give up.&quot;  It was a low blow but the depth of Lupin’s despair worried her.  She hoped he would see sense in a few days; for now, she was prepared to use any argument to stop him from doing something stupid.</P>

<P>Lupin deflated before her eyes, the physical and emotional exertions of the evening evidently catching up with him.  He grabbed one of Molly’s hands and squeezed it.</P>

<P>&quot;I think I’d like to try and get some sleep now,&quot; he said wearily.  &quot;Thank you for listening.&quot;</P>

<P>Molly pushed herself to her feet, acknowledging Lupin’s need to be alone for a while.  &quot;Just call if you want anything,&quot; she told him, then left the room and made her way back down to the others.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>In the days that followed, Lupin haunted Number Twelve as surely as any ghost.  He spent most of his time in Sirius’ room or up in the attic with Buckbeak, only venturing downstairs for meals, where he ate little and spoke less.  He joined in the trip to King’s Cross to meet Harry on his return to London, but then just slipped back into isolation as soon as they got back.  Molly was beginning to wonder if she should talk to him again, when intervention came from an unexpected source.</P>

<P>Lupin was playing half-heartedly with the bacon Molly had just laid down in front of him at breakfast, when Mad-Eye Moody stomped into the kitchen and sat down opposite him.  He waved off Molly’s offer of breakfast and fixed both his eyes on Lupin, who had not even looked up at his entrance.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s a bout time you went to see the boy, Lupin,&quot; Moody said gruffly, without preamble.</P>

<P>Lupin glanced up.  &quot;What?&quot; he said, clearly surprised.</P>

<P>Moodly cleared his throat.  &quot;I said-&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I heard what you said, Alastor,&quot; Lupin interrupted with a snarl, &quot;and you know what I meant.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Lupin,&quot; Moodly warned, his tone severe,&quot; it’s time for you to stop moping about here and make yourself useful to Harry.  You’ve both lost someone very important to you and, while you might think you’re worse off because you knew Black so much better than the boy, in actual fact it’s the other way round for precisely the same reason.  Now, here me out,&quot; he continued before Lupin could interrupt.  &quot;That boy has been all alone his whole life.  Then Black turned up and offered him a glimpse of what it could be like to have a family – and now he’s gone.  At least you knew Sirius before Azkaban changed him, and now you’re Harry’s only real link to his parents and godfather.&quot;  Moody got up from the table and turned to the door, his magical eye remaining fixed on Lupin.  &quot;Think about it.&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Lupin walked down Privet Drive, uncomfortable in jeans and a polo shirt.  He looked around the quiet street with its row of identical houses, and wondered what it would be like to live a dull, monotonous, Muggle existence.  By all accounts, it didn’t suit Harry very well at all, but then he was James Potter’s son so his penchant for high adventure wasn’t very surprising.</P>

<P>It had taken a few days for Moody’s words to sink through the fugue enveloping Lupin’s mind but, eventually, he had come to the conclusion that the battered ex-Auror was right.  If nothing else, he owed it to Sirius to make sure Harry was alright.  So, here he was, very much out of his comfort zone, and fairly apprehensive as to what the afternoon might have in store.</P>

<P>The Dursleys’ front door loomed in front of him, and he knocked loudly.  The door was practically yanked off its hinges as it was opened forcible by Vernon Dursley.  The large man looked Lupin up and down, and snarled, &quot;Yes?  What do you want?&quot;</P>

<P>Lupin smiled graciously and replied politely, &quot;I was hoping to speak to Harry Potter.  Is he in?&quot;</P>

<P>There was a beat of silence, then Dursley’s eyes suddenly bulged out of their sockets and he took a hasty step backwards.  &quot;He’s perfectly fine!&quot; Dursley spluttered, obviously thinking of the threat that had been made at King’s Cross.  &quot;There’s no need for alarm – he’s just upstairs.  Harry!&quot;  This last was bellowed in the direction of the staircase.</P>

<P>There came the sound of a door opening and then thundering feet, and Harry came pounding down the stairs into the hall.  He stopped dead when he saw who was at the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Professor Lupin!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</P>

<P>Lupin smiled warmly, though noting Harry’s pale skin and drawn features.  &quot;I haven’t been a professor for two years, Harry,&quot; he said genially.  &quot;And isn’t it about time you started calling me Remus?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Have you come to take me back to London?&quot; Harry asked eagerly.  Lupin shook his head, and it pained him to see Harry’s face fall.</P>

<P>&quot;I’m afraid not,&quot; he said.  &quot;Dumbledore still thinks you’ll be safer here.  I just stopped by for a visit.&quot;  He eyed Dursley, who had flattened himself against the wall as if trying to pretend he wasn’t there.  &quot;Is there somewhere we can go to talk?&quot;</P>

<P>Harry nodded and pushed past his uncle without a backward glance, leading Lupin down the path and out onto the street.  They turned down an alleyway that opened out into a park at the other end.  Harry selected a secluded bench and sat down, Lupin following suit.</P>

<P>&quot;I’m sorry I haven’t been to see you before now,&quot; Lupin began.  He thought back to the night at the Ministry, when he had had to hold Harry back from following Sirius through the veil.  &quot;The last few weeks have been – difficult, and I’ve been very selfish.  I hope you’ll forgive me for that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Me forgive you?&quot; Harry exclaimed.  &quot;But it was all my fault!  If I hadn’t gone to the Ministry that night, you wouldn’t have had to come and rescue me and Sirius would still be alive.  I wouldn’t be surprised if you never wanted to speak to me again.&quot;</P>

<P>Lupin was shocked; he’d had no idea that Harry might feel that way, and his guilt at wallowing in his own grift for so long intensified.</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing that happened that night was your fault, Harry,&quot; he said firmly.  &quot;You thought Sirius was in danger and you went to help him, just as he then did for you.  You showed tremendous courage and loyalty, and Sirius was immensely proud of you.  He loved you, Harry, and I know he wouldn’t regret giving his life to keep you safe.  I think he would have seen it as redressing the balance after he let your parents down by trusting Peter.  I never could get him to give up his guilt about that.&quot;</P>

<P>Harry was silent for a moment, then said softly, &quot;You loved him, didn’t you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Lupin replied immediately, unwilling to deny it.  &quot;Does that make you uncomfortable?&quot;</P>

<P>Harry returned his gaze steadily.  &quot;No,&quot; he said sincerely.  &quot;I’m glad he had someone.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He was very sorry that we couldn’t offer you a proper home,&quot; Lupin continued.  &quot;We talked about it often, but it just wasn’t possible with things as they were.  Harry, you and I were the closest thing Sirius had to a family and, now that he’s gone, I don’t want that connection to be lost.  I know I could never replace Sirius or your father, and I wouldn’t ever try, but I was wondering if you’d consider me a sort of honorary godfather.  I can’t ask you to come and live with me in the holidays – you may not want to believe it, but you really are better off here – but you can write to me whenever you want, and we can keep in touch via the floo network when you’re at school, if you like.&quot;</P>

<P>Harry gave the first genuine smile Lupin had seen from him since the night at the Ministry.  &quot;I’d like that, Remus,&quot; he said, then he sobered again.  &quot;Will you promise you’ll keep me up to date on what goes on inside the Order?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As much as I can,&quot; Lupin replied seriously.  &quot;As long as you promise to let me know if your scar bothers you, or if you’re worried about anything, no matter how trivial it might seem.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Deal,&quot; Harry agreed.  &quot;Will you do something else for me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If it’s within my power.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Will you tell me about what you and Sirius and my dad got up to when you were at Hogwarts?&quot;</P>

<P>Lupin grinned broadly.  &quot;Gladly!&quot; he said.</P>

<P>THE END – for now</P></FONT></BODY>
