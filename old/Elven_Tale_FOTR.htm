<P>I make no excuses for this relation of my story.  At no point during the events of which I am about to speak did I lose sight of what was at stake, or act in anything other than what I saw at the best interests of our cause.  And yet, you may tell someone a tale in which the entire fate of the world is at stake and it is only when the impact of events is brought down to an individual level that their emotions will be engaged.  The suffering of millions of unknowns is too big a concept for the mind to accept, but everyone can relate to the personal experiences of love, loss and the struggle for survival.  Thus, in telling my own story, I hope to bring people’s attention to the importance of the wider events that surrounded it.  For, my own journey was but a small part of a far bigger tale; the tale of the fight for Middle Earth.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>When word came to Mirkwood that Lord Elrond was calling a council at Rivendell, I was the first to volunteer attendance and my father gave his consent gladly.  Though I have lived many years by the reckoning of men, I am yet in my youth in elvish terms and I knew little of the world outside the borders of our land.  And yet I felt a great sense of duty along with my curiosity, a duty to the free peoples of Middle Earth that might be fulfilled by answering Elrond’s call.</P>

<P>My incomplete presentation here makes me pause, and it will be an empty account indeed if I do not make my full motivations clear at this point.  The most compelling reason for my desire to go to Rivendell was, I force myself to admit, the hope of seeing Aragorn once again.</P>

<P>Elves are taught at a very early age to be on their guard in their dealings with men.  Men are fragile beings, remarkably short-lived, and the Lay of Luthien is set down for us as a warning to guard ourselves against doomed attachments.  Yet, I have learned, to my sweet sorrow, that it is not possible to dictate to your heart where it bestows its love, and it is even less possible to detach that love once it has taken hold, even when it proves fruitless.  My love is ever fixed upon Aragorn, a hopeless object for not only is he doomed to far too brief a life in this world, but also he is irrevocably bound for the span of that life to the Lady Arwen.</P>

<P>I do not relate this to garner sympathy for my plight.  I long ago came to terms with the fact that my love will never be returned in the same form in which it is given, and the deep friendship I share with Aragorn is, and must be, enough to sustain me.  I am not some pathetic creature who wanders about the forest in the depth of night, bemoaning my unrequited love.  However, I admit that the opportunity of seeing Aragorn again after so long a separation drew me to Rivendell with a far stronger pull than even the seriousness of Elrond’s summons.</P>

<P>I rode through the gates of Imladris under the bright sun and everything there was vibrant and beautiful.  The grandeur and serenity of the place seemed incongruous with my purpose there, but it gave me hope that the good in the world might yet prevail.  I looked around me as I dismounted, with fond memories of time spent there years before, and no small hope that Aragorn might be there to greet me.  But he was not present and I inwardly chastised myself for expecting it. We were not gathering to find pleasure in old friends, and the summons to Elrond’s council chamber the following day reminded me of my purpose soon enough.</P>

<P>The group that came together was diverse; a hobbit, the wizard Gandalf, the elves of both Mirkwood and Rivendell, a contingent of dwarves from the mountains, men of Gondor and there, at the furthest edge, between the men and the elves, as if unsure where he truly belonged, was Aragorn.  He looked troubled and careworn, as well he might if the account of events that had reached Mirkwood was true.  But still, his charisma and authority shone through the calm exterior, and I felt sure that destined greatness would soon be forced upon him.</P>

<P>Elrond addressed the gathering.  &quot;Strangers from distant lands, friends of old.  You’ve been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.  Middle Earth stands on the brink of destruction.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn looked up at me then and our eyes met for a moment before he looked away again.  We had not yet spoken, and his gaze communicated both welcome and regret.  I could see his acknowledgement of what dangers faced us and it pained me that he should be compelled to take part in such world-shaping events when all he ever wanted was peace and anonymity.  The lowering of his eyes made me realise that my own had been resting on him since the council began and I berated myself once again, turning my attention fully to Lord Elrond.</P>

<P>&quot;None can escape it,&quot; he continued.  &quot;You will unite or you will fall.  Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.&quot;  He gestured at the hobbit.  &quot;Bring forth the ring, Frodo.&quot;</P>

<P>The hobbit rose up from his chair, walked to the centre of the chamber and placed a heavy, gold ring atop the platform positioned there.  I stared at the item for a moment, then tracked Frodo back to his place in the circle.  He was clearly relieved to have relinquished responsibility of the Ring, and I couldn’t blame him.  Such a small creature, to have carried such a burden all this way!  I had not had any contact with hobbits up to this point, but I decided then and there that they were worthy folk with hidden strengths, and the four I grew to know in the ensuing weeks and months would prove that judgement true time and time again.</P>

<P>But now, another of our circle rose to capture my attention; Boromir, the warrior sent from Gondor.</P>

<P>&quot;So it is true,&quot; he all but whispered, moving towards the Ring in obvious awe.  I watched him with growing concern as he approached the object that was the embodiment of all evil.  I could feel its malicious spirit from my position several feet away and something in Boromir’s look and voice made me suspicious.</P>

<P>&quot;In a dream, I saw the eastern sky grow dark,&quot; the man continued, &quot;but in the west a pale light lingered.  A voice was crying, ‘Your doom is near at hand.  Isildur’s Bane is found.’  Isildur’s Bane…&quot;</P>

<P>How characteristic that men should name the Ring of Power for the damage it did to one of their own; rather Isildur should carry the name of Bane of Middle Earth for his folly in not destroying the Ring when he had the chance.  My breath caught in my throat as Boromir reached out to take hold of the Ring.  Elrond leapt to his feet and called out to stop him, but it was Gandalf who actually drove him back.</P>

<P>The wizard rose and stalked forwards, speaking such words as I have never heard before, in a language I hope never to hear again.  They boomed out, echoing terribly around the chamber as shadows flowed in to darken the sky.  The words themselves pounded at my skull and I closed my eyes against a pain that was not physical, and yet reached into the depths of my very soul.</P>

<P>At last, Gandalf fell silent, leaving the whole company shaken.  Boromir had been pushed backwards to regain his seat, and even Elrond was visibly discomposed.</P>

<P>The Lord of Rivendell turned his eyes to Gandalf and said sternly, &quot;Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here, in Imladris.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandalf himself appeared drained by his powerful oration, but remained unrepentant.</P>

<P>&quot;I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the west.  The Ring is altogether evil.&quot;</P>

<P>But Boromir seemed yet unmoved by what Gandalf had tried to demonstrate, presenting us with his own view of what we should do with the Ring.</P>

<P>&quot;Nay, it is a gift.  A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this ring?  Long has my father, the steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay.  By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe.  Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.  Let us use it against him.&quot;</P>

<P>No longer did I wonder that Aragorn should turn his back on his own people, if this man was the best they could produce.  A short lifespan obviously brings with it a short memory, for it was elves and men together who defeated Sauron all those years ago, and it was a man who allowed his evil to endure in the world.</P>

<P>Aragorn chose this moment to speak up for the first time, his voice a beacon of reason in the face of Boromir’s opposition.  &quot;You cannot wield it.  None of us can.  The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.  It has no other master.&quot;</P>

<P>Boromir turned on him, his answer dripping with contempt.  &quot;And what would a ranger know of this matter?&quot;</P>

<P>I could stay silent no longer.  I was not prepared to let this so-called Lord of Gondor malign the best of men because of his ignorance.  I rose up to challenge him, and declared with all the pride I have in Aragorn’s friendship, &quot;This is no mere ranger.  He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.  You owe him your allegiance.&quot;</P>

<P>I could tell from his expression that Aragorn would rather I had not revealed his identity in this manner, but I was too indignant at the time to pay much heed to his discomfort.  And yet Boromir was still unswayed, his scorn in fact increasing in the light of his new knowledge.</P>

<P>&quot;Aragorn?  This is Isildur’s heir?&quot;</P>

<P>At that, Aragorn sat a little straighter and fixed Boromir with a level gaze, as if daring him to continue.  I could not believe Boromir’s disrespect, and felt the need to drive home the reason why he should listen to Aragorn.</P>

<P>&quot;And heir to the throne of Gondor.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn gestured for me to have done and said in Elvish, &quot;<I>Sit down, Legolas.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>I obeyed him, having nothing more to say in his defence.  But still Boromir persisted in his contempt, an edge of bitterness now creeping into his voice as he, too, retook his seat.</P>

<P>&quot;Gondor has no king,&quot; he said, his gaze fixed on me.  Then he turned to Aragorn and emphasised, &quot;Gondor needs no king.&quot;</P>

<P>It was Gandalf who brought us back to the matter at hand, dismissing this interlude of confrontation by supply ignoring it.</P>

<P>&quot;Aragorn is right,&quot; he said firmly.  &quot;We cannot use it.&quot;</P>

<P>Elrond took the opportunity then to focus the meeting on our next course of action.  &quot;You have only one choice.  The Ring must be destroyed.&quot;</P>

<P>There was no time for us to digest this information as one of the dwarves, na&iuml;ve fool that I at first thought him to be, immediately said impatiently, &quot;Then what are we waiting for?&quot;</P>

<P>He strode up to the platform that held the Ring, lifted his axe high above his head and smote the artifact with all his might.  The blade of his axe exploded on contact with the Ring, the force hurling the dwarf to the ground as we all looked on in horror and amazement.  In the aftermath of this abortive attempt to destroy it, the Ring emitted what sounded like dark mutterings, just too indistinct to make out.  The sound of it was chilling and impressed upon me even further what manner of evil we were dealing with.</P>

<P>To his credit, Elrond addressed the dwarf with the utmost poise and equanimity.  &quot;The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli son of Gloin, by any craft we here possess.  The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.  Only there can it by unmade.  It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.&quot;</P>

<P>Silence fell over the gathering as we all considered the enormity of this task.  The journey described by Elrond was not one from which it would be easy to come back, but doom was just as certain if it was not undertaken at all.  Taking the Ring to the very place where it could do most damage seemed like madness, but I knew Elrond was right; it was the only option.</P>

<P>Of course, it was the man, Boromir, who broke the silence with yet more naysayings.</P>

<P>&quot;One does not simply walk into Mordor.  Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.  There is evil there that does not sleep.  And the great eye is ever watchful.  ‘Tis a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust.  The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.  Not with ten thousand men could you do this.  It is folly.&quot;</P>

<P>I have to admit that it surprised me Boromir should have the ability to paint such an atmospheric picture with his words, and I was relieved he seemed finally to have grasped the seriousness of the situation, but I couldn’t help feeling his pessimism was less than helpful at this juncture.  It frustrated me that he seemed bent on opposing the leaders of the council, and I had to speak up once more.</P>

<P>&quot;Have you heard nothing that Lord Elrond has said?  The Ring must be destroyed!&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli took offence at my tone and turned what I assume were his feelings of humiliation at the events of a few moments before into an attack on my imagined presumption.</P>

<P>&quot;And I suppose you think you’re the one to do it.&quot;</P>

<P>It seems strange to me now that my friendship with Gimli should have developed out of such inauspicious beginnings.  Our mutual mistrust and contempt for one another, built solely upon the ancient prejudices of our two races, here ratcheted the tensions simmering beneath the surface up into a full-blown conflict.</P>

<P>Boromir was not content to accept the finality of my statement, instead choosing to focus on the difficulty of achieving our aim.  &quot;And if we fail, what then?  What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli was still fixating on his own train of thought, leaping once more to his feet and calling out, &quot;I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf.&quot;</P>

<P>In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of Aragorn rolling his eyes, even as I felt Glorfindel bristling beside me and rising to combat Gimli’s insolence.  Aragorn’s maintained calm and obvious despair at how the meeting was deteriorating cooled my temper and stopped me from being further provoked.  I put out my hand to hold Glorfindel back, but it was too late.  Nearly all of the group were now on their feet, and even Gandalf joined in the ensuing argument.  As tempers frayed, men, elves and dwarves descended into a fruitless shouting match, and nobody noticed the young hobbit Frodo getting to his feet and screwing up his courage to take the fate of the world onto his shoulders.</P>

<P>His small voice was almost lost amidst our angry noise.  &quot;I will take it!  I will take it!&quot;</P>

<P>All argument stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and I turned with the others to stare in amazement at the originator of this pivotal statement.</P>

<P>&quot;I will take the Ring to Mordor,&quot; Frodo repeated, then hesitated and seemed to grow even smaller in his embarrassment at so many eyes being upon him.  &quot;Though – I do not know the way.&quot;</P>

<P>The simple honesty of this admission touched my heart and, even though it spoke of inexperience and total lack of preparation, it was hearing those words that first made me think that perhaps Frodo really was the only one of us who could achieve this monumental task.  It was as if his offer had cut through all our antagonism towards one another and showed us a clear path towards our objective.</P>

<P>&quot;I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins,&quot; Gandalf said with a fatherly smile, &quot;as long as it is yours to bear.&quot;  He moved as he spoke, coming to a halt in a position of support behind Frodo, one hand resting on the hobbit’s shoulder.</P>

<P>Aragorn got up then, all his attention fixed on Frodo, his expression intense.  &quot;If, by my life and death, I can protect you, I will.&quot;  He knelt to signify the swearing of loyalty to Frodo’s quest.  &quot;You have my sword.&quot;</P>

<P>I wasn’t about to let Aragorn throw himself into danger alone.  Besides, was it not in search of adventure and fulfillment that I left the safety of the Mirkwood in the first place?  I stepped forward, my admiration for Frodo prompting me to add my sworn companionship to that of Aragorn.</P>

<P>&quot;And you have my bow.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli’s gruff tone added, &quot;And my axe.&quot;</P>

<P>The thought of him joining us irked me at first, but I decided petty squabbles had no place on such an important journey, so I kept my irritation to myself.  What surprised me was that Boromir then approached as well.</P>

<P>&quot;You carry the fate of us all, little one,&quot; he said.  &quot;If this is the will of the council, then Gondor will see it done.&quot;  His arrogance and condescension were still not to my liking, but Elrond and Gandalf seemed satisfied by his volunteering, and it was not my place to oppose them.</P>

<P>The gravity of the situation was suddenly shattered as another hobbit burst through the ranks of volunteers with a shout.  &quot;Here!  Mr Frodo’s not going anywhere without me!&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo’s expression of gratitude at this pronouncement was wonderful to see and I was glad that he would not be alone amongst a company of strangers.  Little did I know at the time how important a part Sam would play in the events to come.</P>

<P>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; Elrond remarked, keeping his tone light, &quot;it is hardly possible to separate you, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.&quot;</P>

<P>But even Elrond’s composure was shaken when two more hobbits scampered in from hiding places at the edge of the chamber.  &quot;Oi!  We’re coming too!&quot; one of them – Merry, I was later to learn – announced.  &quot;You’ll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.&quot;</P>

<P>I wondered if these little folk had any idea what it was they were volunteering for, and the words of the other, Pippin, confirmed all my fears for them.</P>

<P>&quot;Anyway,&quot; he said with the utmost confidence that only comes from almost total ignorance of a situation, &quot;you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission – quest – thing…&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, that rules you out, Pip,&quot; Merry muttered in response.</P>

<P>&quot;Nine companions,&quot; Elrond intoned in an effort to regain control.  &quot;So be it.  You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Right,&quot; said Pippin, then looked up expectantly.  &quot;Where are we going?&quot;</P>

<P>*  *  *  *  *</P>

<P>The following morning, I awoke early with my mind full of the meeting and its consequences.  That I should be part of such an endeavour was at once a source of great pride and of great fear to me.  What had Legolas, Prince of Mirkwood, done thus far in his life to garner the respect and loyalty of his people?  Perhaps this would be my chance to prove my worth – but would I be worthy of this task, and would I survive it?</P>

<P>Before the sun came up, I went out to wander the grounds of Imladris, hoping the peace and calm of Elrond’s realm would quiet my fears and give me the strength to face the day.  As I crossed the courtyard before the great gate, my progress was halted by the sound of my name, spoken by a familiar, breathy voice.  I turned to see the Lady Arwen standing beneath the trees.  In the early morning breeze, her raven hair flowed around her like a living thing, and the pre-dawn light gave her pale skin a translucent, ethereal quality.  The picture of her standing there was breathtaking and I wondered that Aragorn could bear to leave her side for a moment.  She beckoned me over and I approached with a short bow.</P>

<P>&quot;My Lady.&quot;</P>

<P>She smiled at me then, but it was a smile full of sadness.</P>

<P>&quot;Dear Legolas, why so formal?  Between us, there is no need for titles.&quot;</P>

<P>We understood one another, Arwen and I.  It had never been spoken aloud, but I knew she was aware of where my heart lay.  There was no jealousy or conflict between us, only pity and compassion for a shared and hopeless fate.  No doubt she pitied me, for my love was yet more hopeless even than hers, but at least I knew irrevocably my place in Aragorn’s life and had accepted it.  Arwen lived in the constant agony of uncertainty, her happiness reliant on the vagaries of a mortal life, her heart forever tortured by knowing that its object suffered just as much as she.</P>

<P>&quot;He will have need of your love before this quest is over,&quot; she continued, her expression clear and open.  &quot;Will you watch over him while I cannot?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How could you doubt it?&quot; was my reply, though the words were choked with unspoken emotion.</P>

<P>Arwen took my hand and laid it against the skin at the base of her throat, where the Evenstar should hang, and I knew then what she had done.</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing he ever does will change the way I feel about him, nor alter my resolve to bind myself to his mortal life.&quot;</P>

<P>Her directness and generosity should not have surprised me and it does me no credit that they did.  I returned her gaze levelly.  &quot;And nothing I ever do will give you cause to regret that choice,&quot; I told her with all the honesty in my heart.</P>

<P>Her eyes filled with tears and she pulled me into an embrace.  We held each other for a long moment, each taking strength from the other in our plight – I, who would be with Aragorn but forever separated from him, and she, who would live forever in his heart but was forced to remain behind.  When we pulled apart, I brought the conversation back to a safer topic.</P>

<P>&quot;Will you send word to my father of what has passed in the council?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; was her earnest reply.  &quot;Do you have any more personal message to include?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Only that I join this quest in his name and I hope to make him proud of me in this endeavour.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I am sure that is not in question,&quot; she told me with a smile.  &quot;Know that my thoughts and prayers go with you all.  I will watch for your triumphant return.&quot;</P>

<P>Unwilling to dwell on the near impossibility of our task, and unable to deny it in false platitudes, I merely thanked her and took my leave.</P>

<P>*  *  *  *  *</P>

<P>It was full light when we gathered to depart; the nine members of the newly formed Fellowship, Elrond, Arwen and many others.  It was a sombre occasion, the enormity of the situation weighing heavily on everyone’s minds.</P>

<P>Elrond marked our departure with his customary eloquence.  &quot;The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom.  On you who travel with him, no oath or bond is laid to go further than you will.&quot;</P>

<P>I noticed Aragorn exchanging a sorrowful glance with Arwen at this point and my heart ached to see them separated once again.  Arwen surely knew that Aragorn would give everything to aid Frodo, even his life, but it was this very honour and resolve that caused us both to love him, and we would not change him.  We had none of us sworn in any official capacity to do this thing, but our personal sense of duty and loyalty was more binding than any oath.</P>

<P>Elrond continued.  &quot;Farewell.  Hold to your purpose.  May the blessings of elves and men, and all free folk go with you.&quot;</P>

<P>He laid his hand over his heart and then opened it out to us in the traditional elven gesture of good will.  I echoed the movement back to him as a mark of my respect and gratitude for his faith in me.</P>

<P>The silence was broken by Gandalf, who set us all in motion with a few simple words.  &quot;The Fellowship await the Ringbearer.&quot;</P>

<P>The rest of us parted to allow Frodo through.  With all eyes on him, he looked very small indeed, and his expression was one of extreme apprehension, but he took on his mantle of responsibility bravely and led us out of the gates.  I meant to wait and walk with Aragorn, but he lingered behind and I thought it best to allow him a final farewell.  So it was that, as I walked beneath the stone archway that marked the boundaries of Imladris, I heard the uncertain voice of the Ringbearer asking, &quot;Mordor, Gandalf – is it left or right?&quot;</P>

<P>The simple innocence of this question struck a blow to my heart and I wondered what horrors lay in store for Frodo before his journey was over.  Gandalf’s reply was fatherly in tone, and I was incredibly glad that the ancient wizard was with us.  I felt almost as if no real harm could befall us while he was there to guide and protect us.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>And so we set out with both trepidation and resolve.  I know I had no concept at the beginning of exactly what our journey would entail.  Mordor seemed a very long way off, and its remoteness lessened its threat somehow.  I think the mind is not capable of comprehending something so enormous as what we set out to do and the physical progression made it easy just to focus on one stage at a time.  To begin with, all I needed to worry about was setting one foot in front of the other as we walked for days on end through forest, plains and hills on our way to the Gap of Rohan.</P>

<P>There was little conversation as we travelled, but the seriousness of the party was regularly broken by the chatter of Merry and Pippin.  I had been unsure of Elrond’s wisdom in allowing them to come, but I quickly became glad of their presence, as their childlike enthusiasm and eager innocence kept us from falling into the gloom that otherwise threatened.</P>

<P>Perhaps strangest was their effect upon Boromir.  The argumentative and pessimistic man from the council session was transformed into an avuncular guardian of the two hobbits.  He regaled them with tales of the White City and took it upon himself to train them in the art of swordfighting whenever we stopped.  Aragorn joined in with their instruction on occasion and the two quickly improved under such expert tutelage.</P>

<P>We had been on the road some days when we stopped on an outcropping of rock to rest.  Merry and Pippin immediately asked Boromir for another lesson and he readily obliged, while Aragorn looked on, calling out instructions from a rock above them.  He seemed relaxed and happy and I rejoiced to see him so.  Gimli, on the other hand, took the opportunity to bring up a subject that had been frequently on his lips since our departure from Rivendell.</P>

<P>&quot;If anyone were to ask my opinion – which I note they’re not – I’d say we were taking the long way round.&quot;  The reason nobody had asked his opinion that day was because we were all well aware of his thoughts on the matter, but he chose to reiterate them anyway.  &quot;Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.  My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome.&quot;</P>

<P>I wondered that he continued to suggest this course when Gandalf’s answer was always the same – an adamant negative.  &quot;No, Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.&quot;</P>

<P>I did not know Gandalf’s reasons for wishing to avoid Moria, but I was heartily glad of them for I had no wish myself to spend several days underground.  I didn’t know how dwarves could bear it, living in such conditions, without the touch of the sun or the surroundings of nature.</P>

<P>Something caught my attention on the other side of the camp so I leapt across the rocks to take a closer look.  There was what looked like a dark cloud in the distance, but a shiver of apprehension told me it was actually something far more sinister.  I vaguely heard the sounds of a heated skirmish behind me, but the voices were only raised in play so I paid them no heed.</P>

<P>Sam’s voice wafted up.  &quot;What is that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing.  It’s just a wisp of cloud.&quot;  Gimli’s reply was dismissive, but evidently the others had been alerted as Boromir soon joined the discussion.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s moving fast.  Against the wind.&quot;</P>

<P>Suddenly, I realised what I was looking at and called out an urgent warning.  &quot;Crebain from Dunland!&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn caught my meaning immediately, crying, &quot;Hide!&quot;</P>

<P>Whether they understood the danger or not, everyone obeyed without question.  Sam put out the small fire he had built, Boromir took charge of Merry and Pippin, and we all rushed for cover.  I threw myself under a bush, heedless of scratches from thorns, and lay there, awaiting the arrival of our winged enemy.  They burst upon us in a squawking swarm, broadcasting their evil intent with their raucous noise.  They wheeled around the outcropping and then were gone as suddenly as they had appeared.  Everyone scrambled out of their hiding places with evident relief, but Gandalf’s assessment of the situation was not so bright.</P>

<P>&quot;Spies of Saruman.  The passage south is being watched.  We must take the pass of Caradhras.&quot;</P>

<P>All eyes turned to the snow-capped mountain above us, its forbidding presence assuring us that it would not be an easy road.  Gimli looked as though he was about to suggest the mines again, but a resolved shake of the head from Gandalf silenced him.  Trusting in Gandalf’s wisdom, we collected our belongings, screwed up our courage and set out on our new path.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>An arduous climb over steep and rocky ground brought us to an open stretch of virgin snow, leading up to the pass itself.  The sun was out and all about us was unbroken brightness.  It was no hardship to me to walk on the snow, so I placed myself behind the smallest of the hobbits, ready to assist them should they have difficulties.  The first I knew of trouble behind me was when Aragorn called out Frodo’s name.  Turning sharply, I saw Frodo being picked up from the snow by Aragorn.  I watched as he fumbled inside his shirt and discovered the Ring missing, and that’s when I saw Boromir advancing upon the spot where it had fallen.</P>

<P>Aragorn’s hand slipped to the hilt of his sword, and he spoke Boromir’s name as a warning.  But Boromir’s entire focus was now fixed on the golden object suspended from the chain in his hand.  When he spoke, his voice had a distant quality about it.</P>

<P>&quot;It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing.&quot;  He held up his other hand as if about to grasp the Ring.  &quot;Such a little thing.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn called out again, more urgently, &quot;Boromir!&quot;</P>

<P>The other man started as if coming out of a trance and looked up at Aragorn, whose face was very stern.</P>

<P>&quot;Give the Ring to Frodo,&quot; he instructed firmly.</P>

<P>Boromir trudged through the snow and held out the Ring to Frodo, who immediately snatched it from him.</P>

<P>&quot;As you wish,&quot; Boromir said with patently false nonchalance.  &quot;I care not.&quot;  Then he ruffled Frodo’s hair and turned back to the path.</P>

<P>Aragorn visibly relaxed, removing his hand from his sword, and ushered Frodo to follow the rest of us up the slope.  I turned to my own path with the sense that disaster had only narrowly been avoided.  The power of the Ring impressed itself upon me even more in that moment and the importance of our quest held more resonance than ever.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>The snowfields were only our first obstacle in our battle against Caradhras.  By the time we neared the pass itself we were in drifts higher than the hobbits’ heads and a full blizzard was flying directly in our faces.  The men took up two hobbits each in their arms, while Gandalf forged a path and sheltered Gimli with his broad back.  The cold and the depth of the snow were no great hardships to me and I walked lightly atop the drift, alongside the company, watching over them all anxiously.  As the summit came into view before us, I moved to the front of the line and found a solid rocky ledge from which to scout our path.  Looking out into the storm, I heard a voice on the breeze, the words dark and forbidding.</P>

<P>&quot;There is a fell voice on the air,&quot; I called back to Gandalf, who was battling to my side.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s Saruman!&quot; he cried.</P>

<P>At that moment, there was a great cracking noise from above us and a cascade of ice rained down upon us.  I managed to keep my footing and, when it was over, I heard Aragorn’s strained voice coming from behind.</P>

<P>&quot;He’s trying to bring down the mountain!  Gandalf, we must turn back!&quot;</P>

<P>The wind howled around us, driving the snow into every corner of clothing, but still Gandalf’s answer was the same.  &quot;No!&quot;</P>

<P>The wizard clambered up onto the ledge beside me and began to chant, striking up a strong countermelody to Saruman’s attack.  Instead of lessening, though, the storm only grew worse, and then a lightning strike caused yet more ice and rocks down upon us.  This time, there was no chance of staying upright; I was flung from the ledge and quickly buried in snow with the rest.  I fought my way back to the surface again to hear Boromir yell.</P>

<P>&quot;We must get off the mountain!  Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city.&quot;</P>

<P>This time, it was Aragorn who vetoed the alternative plan.  &quot;The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard.&quot;</P>

<P>Boromir fell silent but Gimli took up his own argument again.  &quot;We cannot pass over a mountain.  Let us go under it.  Let us go through the Mines of Moria.&quot;</P>

<P>All eyes turned to Gandalf for a decision and, for a moment, the storm whirled around a silent group as he considered the suggestion, his expression grim.  Then, in an unexpected move, he passed responsibility for our journey to Frodo.</P>

<P>&quot;Let the Ringbearer decide.&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo was clearly taken aback and immediately looked at Sam.  Boromir then used an argument couched so as best to persuade Frodo.  Standing with one arm around each of the smaller hobbits, he cried, &quot;We cannot stay here!  This will be the death of the hobbits!&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin certainly looked very miserable but, to their credit, they had not uttered one word of complaint thus far.</P>

<P>&quot;Frodo?&quot; Gandalf prompted.</P>

<P>Frodo took one more glance at his kinsmen and set our fate.  &quot;Let us go through the mines.&quot;</P>

<P>The authority in his voice took me aback and Gandalf sealed the decision with a resigned, &quot;So be it.&quot;</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>And so we turned once again and set off on the long road back down the mountain.  The atmosphere was one of despondency as we felt as if we were having to begin our journey again, for the third time.  I was certainly not looking forward to entering Moria and it seemed as if we would never make any real progress.</P>

<P>The changing landscape of our journey served only to cast a pall of depression over my mind.  We had set out from the autumnal glory of Rivendell to journey across the plains to Rohan.  The detour up Caradhras had brought us vast expanses of hostile but still beautiful snow.  Now, as we drew closer to Moria, the greenery of the foothills gradually vanished and everything became forbidding and grey.</P>

<P>We had been trudging through unending rocky trails for many hours when we topped a rise and Gimli suddenly pointed ahead, announcing, &quot;The walls of Moria.&quot;</P>

<P>I looked up from where my eyes had been fixed on the uneven ground and saw an enormous cliff of sheer rock.  It looked so hostile and uninviting that I wondered at the pride and anticipation in Gimli’s voice.  How could he be looking forward to entering such a place?  Pinpricks of apprehension travelled up and down my spine at the thought of being trapped underneath the mountain for several days, and I suppressed an involuntary shudder, not wanting to reveal my discomfort to the others, and most especially not to Gimli.</P>

<P>When we reached the cliff face, Gimli strode along it, tapping on the surface with his axe.  &quot;Dwarf doors are invisible when closed,&quot; he told us, as if this was a good thing.  I sensed another long delay to our journey and my frustration started to build.</P>

<P>Gandalf was obviously thinking along the same lines, as he replied with a hint of impatience, &quot;Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why doesn’t that surprise me?&quot; I muttered, my uneasiness translating into sarcasm.  I heard an indignant huff from Gimli, but he said nothing in reply.</P>

<P>Gandalf was also scanning the rockface and I admit I had far more confidence in him finding the entrance than Gimli.  He began muttering to himself, as if thinking aloud.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, let’s see.  Ithildin.  It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.&quot;</P>

<P>Later, I wasn’t sure if he did something to influence them or if the skies merely decided to look favourably upon us but, at that moment, the clouds parted and the full force of the moonlight shone down upon the rock.  Elaborate runes of clearly Elven design immediately appeared, transforming the barren cliff into a thing of beauty.</P>

<P>Gandalf scanned the text and then translated, marking his passage along the words with his staff.  &quot;It reads, ‘The Doors of Durin.  Speak, friend, and enter.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do you suppose that means?&quot; Merry piped up.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, it’s quite simple,&quot; Gandalf informed him.  &quot;If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.&quot;</P>

<P>But, as with most things associated with our quest, it proved to be far from simple.</P>

<P>Gandalf placed the end of his staff at the centre of the door and spoke ancient words in a deep and commanding voice.  There was a moment of expectant silence as we waited to see what would happen, but nothing did.  Thus far undeterred, Gandalf stepped back a pace, raised his arms above his head and spoke again.  Still nothing.  I heard an uncertain rumble from Gimli and I glared down at him.  Considering he had been unable even to find the door, I thought it rather bad grace of him to criticise Gandalf for being unable to open it.</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing’s happening,&quot; Pippin pointed out unnecessarily.</P>

<P>It was when Gandalf then simply tried pushing against the door with his shoulder that I began to realise we might be in trouble.</P>

<P>&quot;I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves, men and orcs,&quot; Gandalf said, as if to himself.</P>

<P>Pippin persisted.  &quot;What are you going to do, then?&quot;</P>

<P>His upturned face showed absolute faith that Gandalf would find the answer, but it prompted the wizard to a frustrated outburst.</P>

<P>&quot;Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!  And if that doesn’t shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will try to find the opening words.&quot;</P>

<P>Everyone wisely left Gandalf alone at this point, and he continued to try various combinations of words and phrases in several different languages.  Merry and Pippin lost interest almost immediately and went to sit by the edge of the lake that ran alongside the cliff wall.  Aragorn and Sam tended to Bill the pony, while Gimli and Boromir set themselves down beneath one of the gnarled and lifeless trees.  Frodo remained before the doors, looking up at the runes intently, as if trying to find an answer to our problem in the writing.</P>

<P>I retreated slightly from the others and stood on the far side of the doors, watching the play of the moonlight on the water.  It was not like the clear, refreshing water of the Mirkwood streams.  It was dark and stagnant, and it had a dead feel about it that set my nerves on edge.  This was nature untended and unloved, nature corrupted and vile.  Much as I disliked the thought of entering Moria, I would rather that and make some sort of progress than stay much longer outside.</P>

<P>After some time, Gandalf suddenly threw down his staff, muttering, &quot;Oh, it’s useless.&quot;  He sat down on a rock, clearly defeated, and took off his hat.  But, as one gave up, another stepped forward to make a try.  Frodo rose from his own rock, his eyes still fixed on the runes.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s a riddle,&quot; he said.  &quot;Speak ‘friend’ and enter.  What’s the Elvish word for ‘friend’?&quot;</P>

<P>Looking up at him, Gandalf replied, &quot;<I>Mellon.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>Immediately, there was the sound of stone moving against stone and the doors slowly opened.  There was no elation in the moment; we were all too cold and uneasy to mark the occasion with anything other than simple movement inside the mines.  Gandalf produced a crystal from within his robes and slotted it into the top of his staff before leading the way.</P>

<P>I followed close behind him and Gimli moved to my side.  As we proceeded into the darkness, he prodded me in the ribs and proclaimed, &quot;Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.  Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!  This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin.  And they call it a mine.  A mine!"</P>

<P>That was the kind of hospitality that would not normally appeal to me, but warmth, light and food were not things at which I would have turned my nose up in that moment.  However, it soon became apparent, as a light began to emanate from Gandalf’s staff, that we would not soon be enjoying those comforts at all.  The doors led into a kind of entrance hall, with stairs leading up to another, inner set of doors.  But the space between was littered with the remains of the dead, skeletons wearing dusty armour, with their violent deaths proclaimed by protruding arrows and shattered bones.</P>

<P>&quot;This is no mine,&quot; Boromir said.  &quot;It’s a tomb.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli cried out his despair at this discovery of his kin, and the hobbits gasped in fear and alarm as they stumbled over the long-dead corpses.  I knelt and retrieved an arrow from where it had lodged in a skull, examining the design.  It was obvious to me who were the perpetrators of these deaths.</P>

<P>&quot;Goblins,&quot; I announced to the rest.</P>

<P>Aragorn and Boromir immediately drew their swords and I quickly joined them in readiness, arming my bow with an Elven arrow of my own.</P>

<P>It was Boromir who issued the instructions.  &quot;We make for the Gap of Rohan.  We should never have come here.  Now, get out of here.  Get out!&quot;</P>

<P>His voice was almost panicked, and I admit the circumstances prompted no small amount of fear in me also.  We all moved backwards, our eyes fixed on the shadows in front of us, constantly expecting enemies to spring from their depths.  But it was behind us that the real danger lay.  Suddenly, the hobbits’ voices were raised desperate pleas for help and I turned to see Frodo lifted up and out over the water by a giant tentacle.  As the men rushed to his aid, I let loose an arrow, which hit one of the other tentacles that had emerged from the water.  Then, before my eyes, the main body of the monster appeared above the surface and opened massive jaws, preparing to swallow Frodo whole.</P>

<P>I fired more arrows as Boromir and Aragorn hacked at the tentacles they could reach with their swords.  Eventually, Aragorn managed to chop at the tentacle that was holding Frodo, and Boromir caught him as he fell from its clutches.  They immediately turned and ran back towards the doors, where the rest of us still stood.</P>

<P>&quot;Into the mines!&quot; Gandalf urged.</P>

<P>I heard Boromir call my name and I sent another arrow into the beast, causing it to pause long enough for the whole party to reach the shelter of the mountain.  But then it surged forwards as if to follow us inside.</P>

<P>&quot;Into the cave!&quot; Aragorn cried, hustling Merry and Pippin before him.  &quot;Run!&quot;</P>

<P>We made it to the foot of the steps before the creature reached out with its tentacles and pulled down the rock of the entrance behind us.  The doors were buried in moments and we were plunged into pitch blackness.  For a moment, I could not move; I was paralysed by horror, my mind frozen and my body trembling.</P>

<P>Then Gandalf’s familiar voice pierced the darkness.  &quot;We now have but one choice.&quot;  He struck the floor with his staff and the crystal lit up, chasing away the shadows.  &quot;We must face the long dark of Moria.  Be on your guard.  There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.&quot;</P>

<P>This did little to reassure me.  After what we had just fought, the last thing I wanted to hear was that there might be worse things yet ahead of us in the mine.  However, as Gandalf had pointed out, there was now no other way for us to go, so I pulled myself together and followed him in the darkness.</P>

<P>I looked back to check on the others as Gandalf continued, &quot;Quietly now.  It’s a four day journey to the other side.  Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.&quot;</P>

<P>I found it difficult to imagine, as we walked through the passages of Moria, how any kind of a home could be made there.  What source of light could reach the corners where the darkest shadows lurked, and what manner of society could be conducted in such harsh and grey surroundings?  As we progressed, I became aware that Gimli was trudging along in depressed silence behind me, and I dropped back to his side.</P>

<P>&quot;Tell me, Master Dwarf, what manner of accommodations might we have enjoyed had we visited here in happier times?&quot;  My intention was not only to bring him out of his gloom, but also hopefully to alleviate my own.  He was silent for a moment and then he sighed deeply, making me think that perhaps I had erred in beginning the subject.  But at last he raised up his eyes to meet mine and smiled wistfully.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, Master Elf,&quot; he said in that deep and rumbling voice of his, &quot;the halls of Balin, Lord of Moria, are renowned in Dwarven lore for their luxury and comfort.  You may look around you and see only barren rock, but the heart of the mine would be magnificent with the finest furnishings and exquisite carvings adorning every pillar.  Oh yes!&quot; he exclaimed in response to my look of surprise.  &quot;The elves do not hold the monopoly on artistry in the world, you know.  We dwarves have produced some fine sculptors and metalworkers in our time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I do not doubt it,&quot; I replied graciously with a nod of apology, before gesturing for him to go on.</P>

<P>And go on he did, relating many a detail of his own home and answering the eager questions of Merry and Pippin, who soon took over my role as interrogators.  The mood of the whole party slowly lightened and I received a smile of gratitude and approval from Gandalf for my efforts.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>About halfway through our journey, we came upon a vast chasm, stretching up and down as far as the eye could see, and forcing us to manouevre along a narrow ledge to reach the other side.  As we crossed, Gandalf put out his hand to the rockface and traced a faint sparkling that travelled over the stone.</P>

<P>&quot;The wealth of Moria was not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril,&quot; he told us.</P>

<P>He held his staff out over the void and, looking down, I could see the raw ore of the substance reflecting back the light right down into the depths.</P>

<P>&quot;Bilbo had a shirt of Mithril rings that Thorin gave him,&quot; Gandalf continued absently.</P>

<P>I heard an indrawn breath from Gimli.  &quot;Oh, that was a kingly gift,&quot; he said in evident awe.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Gandalf replied.  &quot;I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.&quot;</P>

<P>I was impressed.  Monetary wealth has never been of great importance to elves, but I know the dwarves value it greatly, so for one of them to part with such a gift showed in what high regard they must have held Frodo’s uncle.  It seemed that the Baggins line was full of remarkable hobbits.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>It was on the last day of our predicted time beneath the mountain that we drew to a halt at a parting of the ways.  Gandalf had thus far led us confidently through passages and stairways, along ledges and over bridges, but now he stopped before three tunnels, apparently unsure of our route.</P>

<P>&quot;I have no memory of this place,&quot; he said quietly, clearly surprised at this failing of his mind.</P>

<P>A rest was called and we all settled down to wait for a decision on what to do next.  After a few moments, Pippin, who was sitting against a rock very close to me, whispered to his friend, &quot;Are we lost?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; came the immediate reply from Merry.</P>

<P>&quot;I think we are.&quot;  Pippin was not so easily reassured.</P>

<P>But Merry was firm.  &quot;Sh!  Gandalf’s thinking.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin was silent for a few seconds, then said, &quot;Merry?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;  A hint of impatience crept into Merry’s voice.</P>

<P>&quot;I’m hungry,&quot; Pippin complained.</P>

<P>Merry sighed.  &quot;You’re always hungry.&quot;</P>

<P>This exchange carried on for several more minutes and it seemed to me that, for the most part, neither hobbit was really thinking about what they were saying.  The banter was simply a habit, formed to pass the time and to allow them to take comfort in each other in an uncertain situation.  The dynamic of their relationship interested me.  Pippin was the younger, more innocent and playful of the two, looking to Merry to lead and advise him.  Merry often appeared to grow impatient with his young charge, perhaps wanting to present a superior and more mature face to the rest of the company, but he was always solicitous of Pippin’s safety and it was clear there was a deep and abiding affection that bound the two to one another.</P>

<P>On my other side, Boromir and Aragorn sat in not quite companionable silence.  It was obvious to me that Boromir saw Aragorn as a threat to his future power as Steward of Gondor, but at the same time considered him weak and dishonourable for turning his back on his people.  I think Aragorn saw Boromir’s arrogance and close-mindedness as indicative of the reasons he had chosen to remain among the elves.</P>

<P>Of course, elves have, on occasion, also been accused of both arrogance and close-mindedness and it seemed the dwarves might be prone to such faults as well, if Gimli was anything to judge by.  In fact, it had become apparent to me over the course of our journey that, despite our outward differences, the various peoples of Middle Earth were very much alike in the fundamentals.  I thought perhaps that, if we were to succeed in our task as a Fellowship united against the evil of Sauron, it might serve to bring our peoples together in the future and dispel some of the prejudices and hostility that had sprung up in the world.</P>

<P>My reverie was broken by a sudden exclamation from Gandalf.</P>

<P>&quot;Ah!  It’s this way.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He’s remembered,&quot; Merry said with delight as he scrambled to his feet.</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; Gandalf contradicted him, &quot;but the air doesn’t smell so foul down here.  If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.&quot;</P>

<P>So we followed Gandalf’s nose down a dark and winding staircase, which eventually led out into a vast chamber.  When we reached the bottom, Gandalf said, &quot;Let me risk a little more light.&quot;  The crystal atop his staff brightened to reveal endless carved pillars in strictly regimented lines, holding up a roof that was almost impossibly high.  &quot;Behold.  The great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf.&quot;</P>

<P>We all gazed around us in amazement at the architectural feat and Sam summed up our feelings in his own, inimitable way.  &quot;Now there’s an eye-opener, and no mistake.&quot;</P>

<P>We had not gone much further when Gimli suddenly gave a cry and veered off into a side room.  Gandalf called to stop him, but it was too late and we were forced to follow.  On entering, I saw Gimli on his knees, weeping over a tomb in the centre of the room.  There were more bodies, both dwarf and orc, in evidence.  Gandalf walked over to the tomb and read the words inscribed upon it.</P>

<P>&quot;’Here lies Balin, son if Fundin, Lord of Moria.’  He is dead then.  It’s as I feared.&quot;  The wizard passed his hat and staff to Pippin and picked up a book from where it lay on the floor.</P>

<P>The hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end, and I felt a dark presence in the distance.  Stepping up beside Aragorn, I said, &quot;We must move on.  We cannot linger.&quot;</P>

<P>He did not question me, only glancing his agreement, but we were at the mercy of circumstance and Gimli showed no sign of moving.  Gandalf opened the book he held to the last few pages that contained writing, and read aloud to us.</P>

<P>&quot;’They have taken the bridge and the second hall.  We have barred the gates but cannot hold them for long.  The ground shakes.  Drums, drums in the deep.  We cannot get out.  A Shadow moves in the dark.  We cannot get out.’&quot;  He broke off and looked up sharply at us before concluding, &quot;’They are coming.’&quot;  This relation of the last stand of the Moria dwarves served only to increase my sense of urgency that we move on.</P>

<P>What nobody had noticed was that Pippin’s attention had been caught by a skeleton perched precariously on a well on the other side of the chamber.  Before anyone could stop him, he reached out to touch it and it immediately fell away from him and down the well.  The crashes of its progress echoed into the distance, and Pippin winced at each one, as well he might.  At last, silence descended once more and we all stood motionless, holding our breath in suspense for a moment.</P>

<P>Then Gandalf rounded on Pippin and cursed, &quot;Fool of a Took!  Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin looked suitably chagrined, but unfortunately the incident didn’t end there.  Distant drums reached our ears and Sam gestured at Frodo’s sword, the blade Sting given to him by Bilbo before we left Rivendell.  It was glowing with an ethereal blue light and that could only mean one thing.</P>

<P>&quot;Orcs,&quot; I spat with distaste.</P>

<P>Boromir ran to the door but it became clear our escape route was blocked when two arrows whistled past his head to embed themselves in the wood.  Aragorn instructed the hobbits to stay close to Gandalf, while I moved to help Boromir with the door.</P>

<P>&quot;They have a cave troll,&quot; he remarked with sarcastic delight.</P>

<P>We quickly barred the doors as best we could and then stepped back, readying our weapons for the coming battle.  Gimli had climbed atop Balin’s tomb and was brandishing his axe, a fierce glint in his eye.</P>

<P>&quot;Let them come!&quot; he cried.  &quot;There is one dwarf yet in Moria that draws breath.&quot;</P>

<P>There was a battering at the door and I held my bowstring taut, ready to loose an arrow as soon as a gap was made.  The opportunity was not long in coming and both Aragorn and I managed to despatch a couple of the enemy before they even breached the door.  But there were plenty more behind and they quickly gained access, pouring into the chamber like vermin.  The battle was frenzied for a while, with even the hobbits entering the fray, but the orcs were undisciplined and too cocksure, leaving them vulnerable to our more skilled attack.</P>

<P>The cave troll was another matter.  It rampaged around the confined space, laying waste to anything that moved nearby with its huge mace.  Afterwards, I thought it probably didn’t even know why it was fighting, but that didn’t stop it posing a real danger to us.  At one point I managed to get onto its back and fire two arrows at point blank range into its neck, but its hide was tough and what wounds I made barely slowed the creature down.</P>

<P>When Merry and Pippin also tried their luck on the troll’s shoulders, I finally saw an opening.  As soon as it reared its head back, I aimed an arrow into its open mouth.  The shaft found its mark, travelling through the roof of the troll’s mouth and straight into its brain.  It put its hand up to its lips as if in confusion, then it staggered from side to side and finally toppled over, flinging Pippin from its back as it fell.</P>

<P>It was then I saw Aragorn rush over to where Frodo lay motionless on the ground.  I had not seen him fall, but my heart was in my mouth as Aragorn gently turned him over.</P>

<P>Aragorn’s soft, &quot;Oh, no,&quot; had me fearing the worst, but Sam quickly dispelled my anxiety by proclaiming, &quot;He’s alive.&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo himself confirmed it by sitting up and announcing to a relieved company, &quot;I’m alright.  I’m not hurt.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn was incredulous.  &quot;You should be dead.  That spear would have skewered a wild boar.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I think there’s more to this hobbit than meets the eye,&quot; Gandalf surmised, drawing closer to Frodo as if to see the evidence of his health for himself.</P>

<P>As we watched, Frodo drew back the edges of his ripped tunic to reveal the glint of something shiny underneath.</P>

<P>&quot;Mithril!&quot; Gimli exclaimed, identifying the very shirt of Bilbo’s we had been discussing two days before.  &quot;You are full of surprises, Master Baggins!&quot;</P>

<P>The moment of triumph was short-lived, however, as the sound of more orcs approaching reached our ears.</P>

<P>&quot;To the bridge of Khazad-dum!&quot; Gandalf instructed and we all headed back out between the pillars of Dwarrowdelf.</P>

<P>But the ravening hordes had been alerted to our presence.  As we ran, I saw orcs swarming down from above us.  They came at us from all sides and eventually we were forced to a halt as they completely surrounded us.  We all readied ourselves for another battle, even though it was clearly futile as we were hopelessly outnumbered.  There was a tense stand-off as the front rank of orcs were reluctant to throw themselves upon our blades, and then, as quickly as they had appeared, the entire host of the enemy simply melted away into the darkness.  I looked about me in confusion and noticed a red glow emanating from down one of the hallways.  Whatever the source, it was moving closer, casting its baleful light over the rock as it progressed.</P>

<P>&quot;What is this new devilry?&quot; Boromir asked.</P>

<P>&quot;A Balrog,&quot; Gandalf answered him grimly.  &quot;A demon of the ancient world.  This foe is beyond any of you.  Run!&quot;</P>

<P>We ran.  Through the empty halls and out into a new chamber we ran.  Boromir was in the lead but he was brought up short when the path we trod took a sharp left down some stairs and he nearly toppled out over the edge.  I was just behind him and managed to grab him before he fell.  He collapsed back onto me, knocking the wind out of me but there was no time to recover my breath as we continued relentlessly on down the stairs.  They were treacherous and crumbled beneath our feet, winding this way and that to slow us further.</P>

<P>A gap in the stair did not slow me down; I simply maintained my momentum and leapt over it, only halting on the other side to check on the progress of the others.  Gandalf was behind me and I called out to him, gesturing for him to jump.  I caught him as he landed, helping him to regain his balance.  Boromir came next, bringing Merry and Pippin with him and causing more of the rock to crumble away as they pushed off.  Aragorn practically threw Sam across, then reached for Gimli, who shoved off his hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Nobody tosses a dwarf,&quot; he proclaimed before trying to jump across the gap by himself.  His feet touched the opposite edge, but he started to fall backwards so I grabbed him by the beard, despite his protests, and hauled him to safety.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, whatever was pursuing us was getting ever closer.  Its size and power was apparent by the shaking of the ground that reverberated around us and I wondered what manner of beast could frighten even Gandalf.  Aragorn and Frodo were yet to bridge the gap in the stairs when a particularly violent tremor caused a large piece of rock to fall from above, destroying the stairway behind them and leaving them on a precariously balanced pinnacle.</P>

<P>When it became obvious that the rock they were standing on was now unstable, Aragorn instructed Frodo to lean forward, trying to influence the direction in which it would fall.  They rode the rock as it toppled towards us and then jumped at the last minute.  Aragorn landed in my arms and I waited until I was sure he had his feet before I let go.</P>

<P>&quot;Over the bridge!  Fly!&quot; Gandalf cried.</P>

<P>The bridge was a narrow strip of rock spanning a vast chasm, but there was no time to be nervous about crossing.  We all ran to the other side and started up the stairs.</P>

<P>I heard Gandalf call out behind me, &quot;You cannot pass!&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo called his name, causing the rest of us to stop and look back.  What we saw was Gandalf standing alone in the middle of the bridge, facing a monster, the like of which I had never before imagined.  It was huge, a great hulking creature that seemed to be made from darkness that flamed as it moved.  It held a whip of fire in its massive hand and breathed out superheated gas.</P>

<P>Gandalf stood his ground, raising his staff above his head and casting a sphere of blinding white light around himself.</P>

<P>&quot;I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor!  The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Undun!  Go back to the Shadow!  You shall not pass!&quot;</P>

<P>With that, he brought the staff down upon the bridge in front of him, splintering the rock.  The Balrog hesitated, but then took one step forwards.  It would be its last; the bridge collapsed beneath it and it fell into the void.  Relief flooded through me, but it was short-lived.  Gandalf turned to join us but, as he started to move, the end of the Balrog’s whip flicked up and wrapped itself around his ankle, yanking him off the bridge.  He managed to catch hold of the edge and hung there for an endless agonising moment.</P>

<P>Frodo surged forwards but Boromir caught hold of him and held him as he struggled to go to the wizard’s aid.  When his purpose was thwarted, he let out an anguished cry of, &quot;Gandalf!&quot;  The horror and despair in his voice chilled my heart, but there was nothing we could do.</P>

<P>Gandalf looked up at us, called out, &quot;Fly, you fools!&quot; and then he was gone, tumbling down into the darkness like something out of a nightmare.</P>

<P>I stood frozen for a moment but snapped out of my hesitation when arrows started falling around us, fired by orcs on the far side of the bridge.  I turned with the rest and fled up the stairs towards the outside world.  The staircase was short and I burst suddenly out into the light, continuing to run for a distance before realising that we had at last left the dark of Moria.  But there was no joy in this realisation, as we had left behind the best of our party.</P>

<P>I stumbled to a halt, looking about me in confusion, not able quite to grasp what had happened.  How was it possible that Gandalf, our leader, our guide, the most powerful among us, could be lost?  I could not comprehend it.</P>

<P>The next thing I was aware of was Aragorn speaking my name.  His tone was hard.</P>

<P>&quot;Legolas, get them up.&quot;</P>

<P>I glanced around and saw the hobbits collapsed on the rocks, weeping.</P>

<P>&quot;Give them a moment, for pity’s sake!&quot; Boromir begged, but Aragorn rounded on him, speaking harshly through what I knew had to be intense grief of his own.</P>

<P>&quot;By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.  We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.  Come, Boromir.  Legolas, Gimli, get them up.&quot;</P>

<P>I watched, still dazed, as he approached Sam and lifted him up.  &quot;On your feet, Sam,&quot; he said, his tone softening slightly.  Then he called to Frodo, gathering us all together before leading us onwards.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>And so Aragorn stepped immediately but reluctantly into the gaping void left by Gandalf.  Our new leader drove us relentlessly and thanklessly away from the danger of Moria until the hobbits could run no further and we were forced to take a break.</P>

<P>My mind was still a blank; I had been running entirely on instinct, unwilling to contemplate what had happened underneath the mountain.  Death was not something that had touched me before, protected as I had been in the peace and safety of the Mirkwood, surrounded by my kin, who would live forever.</P>

<P>We had reached the end of the hills, and would not have far to go to reach the forest.  There were a couple of trees growing in the place where we stopped, and I sank down beneath one of them, trying to ground myself with the familiar feel of bark at my back.</P>

<P>Not long afterwards, I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder and heard my name spoken softly.  I looked up to see Aragorn standing above me, his face a mask of sadness.  He sat down beside me and searched my face with concern.</P>

<P>&quot;I do not understand,&quot; I said, the confusion boiling up out of me and seeking any explanation that would make sense of it.</P>

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Aragorn replied, and I realised there were no answers he could give me.</P>

<P>&quot;How is it that you humans live with this constant threat of death day after day?&quot;  I altered my train of questioning, suddenly astounded that his race could cope at all.  &quot;I know that elves may be killed as easily as any other creature by violence or accident, but you who have such short lives must carry the knowledge of impending doom with you always.  How do you bear it?  And how do you grow accustomed to the fear of losing your loved ones in such a fashion?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We cannot,&quot; Aragorn told me gravely.  &quot;And so we should not.  Every day that is granted to us should be seen as a blessing, and the shortness of our lives as an incentive to make good use of every moment.  Complacency is not something we can afford and so we take care to appreciate whatever span of life is allotted to us.  Thus we live, if we have sense and a good disposition.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Such an attitude is a great credit to your race,&quot; I said, impressed by his philosophy, though it did little to comfort me, &quot;but if one as ancient and powerful as Gandalf is at the mercy of the fates, I fear there is little hope for any of us.  It bodes ill for our quest to have lost him in so senseless a manner.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn squeezed my shoulder and, in my weakness, I leaned into his support.  &quot;But, to Gandalf, his death would not seem senseless, I warrant.  This task which we pursue, is far greater than any one individual, and the deaths that will result in our failure would be far more than this one.  Gandalf sacrificed himself so that we might continue on and succeed in our quest, and I believe he did so willingly and without regret.  I do not think he would have us despair.  Rather, we should pay tribute to him in the proper manner by forging onwards with determination and resolve.  Do not be heavy-hearted, Legolas.  It suits you ill and Gandalf would not thank you for it.&quot;</P>

<P>Gaining a measure of composure from both his words and his touch, I managed a small smile.  &quot;You are right, my friend,&quot; I said, &quot;and I thank you for the comfort you have given me.  I fear for the hobbits, though.  They are less equipped even than I to deal with such tragedy, sheltered as their lives have hitherto been.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I think they may yet surprise you with their resilience,&quot; Aragorn maintained. &quot;This is a heavy blow for them, to be sure, as it is for us all, but they gain strength and comfort from one another, and they are not ones to give up easily once they have pledged to do something.  Gandalf had faith in them, and so should we.&quot;  He looked up at the sky then and frowned.  &quot;And we should also move on.  We have lingered here long enough.&quot;</P>

<P>With that, he rose and called to everyone that it was time to go.</P>

<P>* * * *</P>

<P>I was expecting to feel some kind of relief when we finally reached the boundaries of Lothlorien, but there was no lessening of the tension that made my muscles ache.  We slowed our pace as we entered the trees and I heard Gimli speaking to the Shire folk.</P>

<P>&quot;Stay close, young hobbits.  They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.  An elf-witch of terrible power.  All who look upon her fall under her spell and are never seen again.&quot;</P>

<P>At any other time, his superstition would probably have been amusing to me, but I was too much on edge to really register what he was saying.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, here’s one dwarf she won’t ensnare so easily,&quot; he bragged.  &quot;I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.&quot;</P>

<P>Suddenly, we were surrounded by elves pointing bows directly in our faces.  My reflexes were still on a hair trigger from Moria and I drew my own bow on instinct, not thinking about who it was I was aiming at.  I merely saw a threat and reacted accordingly.  In front of me, Aragorn lifted his hands both in surrender and as a calming gesture.  Then, a familiar figure stepped forward and the ironic tones of Haldir of Lorien reached my ears.</P>

<P>&quot;The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.&quot;</P>

<P>Gradually, I began to relax, knowing now that we were among friends.  I lowered my bow as the Lothlorien elves did the same, and I approached Haldir.</P>

<I><P>&quot;Welcome, Legolas, son of Thranduil,</I>&quot; he said in Elvish and it was music to my ears to hear my language again.  I had not realised how much I missed it and it was most welcome in my current frame of mind.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Our Fellowship stands in your debt, Haldir of Lothlorien,</I>&quot; I replied.</P>

<P>Then he turned to Aragorn.  &quot;<I>Aragorn of the Dunedain, you are known to us.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>At that point, the greetings were interrupted by a rude outburst from Gimli, who exclaimed, &quot;So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!  Speak words we can all understand!&quot;</P>

<P>Haldir looked down his nose at Gimli, his expression contemptuous.  &quot;We have not had dealings with the dwarves since the Dark Days,&quot; he said, and I knew that would not likely appease Gimli.</P>

<P>Sure enough, he retorted, &quot;And you know what this dwarf says to that?&quot;  He lapsed into the harsh syllables of the dwarf language and, judging from Aragorn’s reaction, I was glad neither myself nor Haldir could understand him.</P>

<P>Aragorn rolled his eyes and grabbed Gimli’s arm.  &quot;That was not so courteous,&quot; he said sternly, attempting to halt the confrontation before it spiralled out of control.</P>

<P>However, it was not Gimli’s bad manners that hindered our progress, since Haldir’s attention at that point turned to Frodo.  &quot;You bring great evil with you,&quot; he said warily.  &quot;You can go no further.&quot;</P>

<P>Frodo looked understandably troubled by this, and I felt sorry for him, carrying such a burden and being the cause of this new delay.  Aragorn immediately started trying to persuade Haldir, while the remainder of the group took the opportunity for a rest in relative safety.</P>

<P>Aragorn argued and pleaded, reiterating the importance of our quest and our desperate need for shelter over and over again.  I admit I was too weary in both body and spirit to pay close attention to what was said, so I do not know how he at last persuaded Haldir to allow us entry to Lothlorien.</P>

<P>All I do know is that, after what seemed like an age, Haldir approached the main group and announced simply, &quot;You will follow me.&quot;</P>

<P>He led us through the forest until a magnificent group of trees came into view.  &quot;Caras Galadhon,&quot; he told us with pride and reverence in his voice.  &quot;The heart of Elvendom on earth.  Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.&quot;</P>

<P>The wonder of the place was all but lost on me, as I concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other.  We climbed stairs that wound around a great tree, and at last arrived on a large platform, where we drew to a halt.  A bright light appeared before us and two glorious elves emerged from within it, Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel.  They moved slowly and with the utmost grace, looking down upon us with compassion.</P>

<P>&quot;The enemy knows you have entered here,&quot; Lord Celeborn said.  &quot;What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.&quot;  He glanced around the group.  &quot;Eight there are here, yet nine set out from Rivendell.  Tell me, where is Gandalf?  For I much desire to speak to him.&quot;  He paused and his eyes grew distant for a moment.  &quot;I can no longer see him from afar.&quot;</P>

<P>Galadriel spoke then, her voice ethereal and her focus clearly on some higher plane of awareness.  &quot;Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.  He has fallen into Shadow.&quot;  Celeborn glanced over at her in alarm.</P>

<P>I looked up then, meeting her gaze steadily, but with terrible grief and regret welling up in my heart.  &quot;He was taken by both Shadow and Flame,&quot; I told her.  Some bitterness crept into my voice then.  &quot;A Balrog of Morgoth.  For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life,&quot; Galadriel countered, her words washing over me like a soothing balm.  &quot;We do not yet know his full purpose.&quot;  Her eyes then fixed on Gimli, who was looking at the ground.  &quot;Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dum fill your heart, Gimli, son of Gloin.  For the world has grown full of peril and in all lands love is now mingled with grief.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What now becomes of this Fellowship?&quot;  Celeborn voiced the question that had been in my mind ever since we had left Moria.  &quot;Without Gandalf, hope is lost.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The quest stands upon the edge of a knife,&quot; Galadriel told us.  &quot;Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all.  Yet hope remains while the company is true.&quot;  She smiled then.  &quot;Do not let your hearts be troubled.  Go now and rest, for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.  Tonight, you will sleep in peace.&quot;</P>

<P>I wished that would be so with all my heart, but could not imagine I would be able to escape my grief successfully enough to sleep at all that night.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>We were shown to a large clearing where there were beds for us to use and a pool of water.  The elves attending us provided us with food and then left us alone.  After we had refreshed ourselves, far off singing became audible, coming from high up in the trees.  I listened for a while and announced the subject of the song to the others.</P>

<P>&quot;A lament for Gandalf.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do they say about him?&quot; Merry wanted to know, but I did not feel equal to providing a translation.</P>

<P>&quot;I have not the heart to tell you,&quot; I admitted apologetically.  &quot;For me the grief is still too near.&quot;</P>

<P>Sam rose then and began talking of Gandalf’s fireworks, but I could not bear to hear memories of him spoken so I left the camp and wandered deeper into the woods of Lothlorien, seeking peace from my swirling emotions.  I thought of what Aragorn had said about death, and what Galadriel had said about Gandalf’s hidden purpose, but it did not help.  My confusion and grief built up upon one another until I could walk no further and fell to my knees at the edge of a stream in a clearing far away from the city.</P>

<P>I do not know how long I stayed there.  I shed no tears, but my mind went round and round in circles, Frodo’s last anguished call of Gandalf’s name echoing endlessly in my thoughts.</P>

<P>A soft voice made me start.  &quot;Why do you suffer alone, Legolas?&quot;</P>

<P>I spun on my heels to see Haldir approaching from out of the trees.  I said nothing and he knelt before me in the grass, his eyes bright with concern.</P>

<P>&quot;There are many in Lothlorien who would offer you comfort should you desire it,&quot; he said and his meaning was clear.</P>

<P>I dropped my gaze to the ground between us and murmured in reply, &quot;My love belongs to another.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But he does not return it.&quot;  There was only compassion in Haldir’s words.  He reached out and ran a finger down my cheek.  &quot;I know that when one of our kind falls in love it is deep and lasting, and I confess I almost envy you that you have experienced that.  But when the great love cannot be fulfilled, do you not have room in your heart for smaller loves, offered by those who can provide solace and release from your burdens, if only for a short while?&quot;</P>

<P>I looked up again to meet his searching gaze.  &quot;No questions,&quot; he said.  &quot;No expectations, no ties.  All I offer is comfort and a little pleasure in these dark times.&quot;  He smiled at me then, and I felt a wave of desire wash over me, desire for an intimacy that I had not experienced in a long time.</P>

<P>He waited, allowing me to direct what happened next.  And what happened was that I slowly leaned forwards until our lips met in a chaste kiss.  He tasted sweet and suddenly I wanted much, much more.  I brought my arms up to encircle him and pushed my tongue between his lips.  That was all the encouragement he needed and soon we lay entangled together in the grass, our passion building as I let go and gave myself permission to feel.</P>

<P>After our lovemaking, Haldir held me in his strong embrace as I slept and, for the first time since leaving Rivendell, I felt truly safe.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>

<P>The following morning, we took our leave of Lothlorien, but it was a parting blessed with much kindness and generosity.  We were each given an elven cloak and individual gifts.  Mine was a magnificent bow, presented to me by Galadriel herself and I received it with reverence and great gratitude.</P>

<P>The Lothlorien elves also provided us with provisions for the journey and, most importantly, boats so that we could make much better time by travelling the river.  Aragorn took Frodo and Sam in his boat, the other two hobbits going with Boromir, which left Gimli as the passenger in my boat.</P>

<P>As we sailed away from the forest, Gimli sighed deeply and said, &quot;I have taken my worst wound at this parting, having looked my last upon that which is fairest.  Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.&quot;</P>

<P>My curiosity got the better of me and I asked, &quot;What was her gift?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I asked her for one hair from her golden head.&quot;  He paused for a moment, then continued wistfully, &quot;She gave me three.&quot;</P>
</FONT>
<P>I smiled at the change Lothlorien had wrought in Gimli.  All his fears on entering the forest had come true; the elven sorceress had enchanted him to such a degree that his heart would now forever be hers.  The two least alike among the Fellowship now had something in common – Gimli and I shared a hopeless love for extraordinary people who were irrevocably unattainable, and neither of us minded in the least.</P>

<P>As if he was reading my mind, the dwarf suddenly asked, &quot;How long have you been in love with yon ranger then, laddie?&quot;</P>

<P>His directness caught me completely offguard, but the context of our conversation and his invitation to my confidence made me reply without a thought.  &quot;Almost as long as I can remember,&quot; I confessed.</P>

<P>Now it was Gimli’s turn to be surprised.  &quot;What?&quot; he cried and tried to turn to look at me, aborting the movement when it caused the boat to rock dangerously.  He was forced to question me with his back to me.  &quot;But surely you are centuries older than Aragorn!&quot;</P>

<P>His assumption amused me greatly.  I believe Gimli was, in his way, just as ignorant as I of the world outside his home before we set out on the journey of the Fellowship.  However, where my mind was a blank slate that was rapidly being filled up with all the things I was discovering, Gimli’s mind was full of false facts and misconceived ideas that were slowly being stripped away.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, Gimli,&quot; I said, enjoying the opportunity to teach him something, &quot;I am not as old, nor Aragorn so young as you might think.  Even elves are young once, and I have yet to reach my eightieth year.  Aragorn is, in fact, nearly ten years my senior.&quot;</P>

<P>As I had thought, this answer did not satisfy the dwarf’s belief in his own knowledge.  &quot;Even if it’s true that you are such a youngling, and that would explain a few things,&quot; he quipped, &quot;no man lives that long.  Aragorn looks to be only half way through his years and men are lucky to reach eighty in the full course of their lives.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Indeed it is so,&quot; I agreed, &quot;but Aragorn is one of the Dunedain and to them is granted a lifespan twice that of an average man.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That is still only a brief moment to an elf,&quot; Gimli pointed out, &quot;which leaves you in a pretty pickle.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The brevity of Aragorn’s life, much though it grieves me, is not the biggest obstacle,&quot; I told him.  &quot;Aragorn is bound, heart and soul, to the Lady Arwen, and I would not see them put asunder for all the world.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli’s voice softened.  &quot;Ah, but you’ve a good heart, Legolas.&quot;</P>

<P>We rowed on in silence, each lost in contemplation of our plight.  And yet, in the revelation of our feelings to each other, a friendship was formed between Gimli and I that neither of us had expected.  And it was a friendship that would prove precious to us both in the dark times that beckoned.</P>

<P>* * * * *</P>
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">
<P>The river gave speed to our passage, but still I sensed we were not safe from pursuit.  Celeborn’s warning about secrecy stuck in my mind and I was ever watchful as we rowed, alert and listening for any other creatures that stirred nearby.  More than once I heard the echoing of heavy feet moving through the underbrush and I know Aragorn heard it too, but never did the enemy show themselves while we were on the river.</P>

<P>We passed the Argonath, the huge and ancient statues rising from the riverbank in all their majesty.  I saw Aragorn looking at them with pride and wonder, and I was glad he had the opportunity to see them, despite our purpose there.</P>

<P>Eventually, we reached a great waterfall and the boats could take us no further.  Aragorn directed us to a landing on the western bank and we secured the boats at his instruction.</P>

<P>&quot;We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot,&quot; he told us.  &quot;We approach Mordor from the north.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli immediately started pouring pessimism on the plan.  I listened with only half an ear as he described the obstacles we were yet to face, the rest of my attention taken up by the sense of impending danger that was dogging my thoughts.  I scanned the trees carefully, searching for any sign that an enemy was near, but saw nothing.  I was convinced, however, that we were not safe and all my instincts were telling me that we should press on.</P>

<P>Aragorn waited patiently until Gimli had finished his speech, then said calmly and firmly, &quot;That is our path.  I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.&quot;</P>

<P>That was enough to render Gimli practically speechless with indignation and I took the opportunity to raise my concerns with Aragorn.</P>

<P>&quot;We should leave now,&quot; I said quietly.</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Orcs patrol the eastern shore.  We must wait for cover of darkness.&quot;</P>

<P>I was not sure darkness would help us and my urge to continue on remained strong.  &quot;It is not the eastern shore that worries me,&quot; I told him.  &quot;A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.  Something draws near.  I can feel it.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn considered my words for a moment, and I was gratified that he took my warning seriously, even though I had no hard evidence to back it up.  The discussion became moot, however, when Merry suddenly said, &quot;Where’s Frodo?&quot;</P>

<P>We all looked round and quickly discovered that Boromir was also missing.  My sense of danger increased, my mind filling with suspicion and fear at what might befall Frodo while he was separated from us, and what might Boromir’s intentions be should he find himself within reach of the Ring.</P>

<P>&quot;We must find them,&quot; I said.  &quot;I fear our pursuers may be close by.&quot;</P>

<P>We left the rest of the hobbits with the boats and set out in search of our missing companions, Aragorn taking one direction while Gimli and I went in another.</P>

<P>Gimli’s mood had not brightened.  &quot;What does that fool young hobbit think he’s at, wandering off in the wilderness?&quot; he grumbled.</P>

<P>&quot;It is Boromir who worries me,&quot; I told him.  &quot;I fear he is not strong enough to resist the Ring, should it try to manipulate him.  Frodo may have the will to resist its pull, but he is vulnerable to physical attack and will not be on guard against one of our company.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You really believe Boromir will betray the Fellowship?&quot; Gimli questioned.</P>

<P>&quot;I know Aragorn suspects him.  They have argued more than once about taking the Ring to Gondor.  I do not think Boromir would willingly harm Frodo.  He is not evil, but he is weak.  The Ring will seek out any weakness it can find and make use of it.&quot;  I fixed Gimli with a serious look.  &quot;I would not like to be tested by it.&quot;  I stopped then, as the sound of blades clashing reached my ears.  &quot;Aragorn,&quot; I breathed, then turned back in the direction he had taken.  &quot;Come, Gimli.  It is as I feared.  The enemy have found us.&quot;</P>

<P>We raced through the trees, following the sounds of battle, until we came out onto a rise of land.  Aragorn was in the midst of a whole host of Uruk-hai, fighting for all he was worth.  Gimli and I launched ourselves into the fray.  I assumed Aragorn was still looking for Frodo, and was worried that the Uruk-hai might have waylaid the young hobbit, so I worked to clear a path for Aragorn through the enemy.  Once I had freed him slightly from the onslaught of the Uruk-hai, I shouted, &quot;Aragorn!  Go!&quot;</P>

<P>But he did not leave us, instead redoubling his efforts against our foes, and the three of us fought side by side.  We cut down orc after orc but the number coming against us never seemed to lessen.  Then a clear musical note came through the trees, a cry for help from another part of the forest.</P>

<P>&quot;The horn of Gondor,&quot; I called out to the others.</P>

<P>Aragorn cried, &quot;Boromir!&quot;</P>

<P>He immediately turned and set of at a run towards the call of the horn.  Gimli and I followed at a slower pace, hindered by the Uruk-hai who pursued us.  At last, though, the enemy grew fewer and, by the time we reached our destination, there were none left to fight.  But we were too late to help Boromir.  He lay on the grass with three arrows protruding from his body, Aragorn at his side.  I skidded to a halt some distance away, Gimli behind me, and Boromir’s last words reached my ears.</P>

<P>&quot;I would have followed you, my brother.  My captain.  My king.&quot;  And then he breathed no more.</P>

<P>A sharp grief struck my heart at this loss of another of our party, especially considering my earlier words against him, and I heard a deep sigh from Gimli, echoing my own feelings.</P>

<P>&quot;Be at peace, son of Gondor,&quot; Aragorn murmured, then leaned forwards and kissed the fallen man’s forehead.  He rose and turned to us, his voice heavy with sadness.  &quot;They will look for his coming from the White Tower.  But he will not return.&quot;</P>

<P>Then he stooped and lifted Boromir’s body in his arms.  I stepped forward to help him but he only shook his head, setting off back to the riverbank.  When we reached our camp, it was empty.</P>

<P>&quot;Where are Merry and Pippin?&quot; I asked in alarm.</P>

<P>&quot;Boromir said the Uruk-hai took them captive,&quot; Aragorn replied grimly.  &quot;They must believe they carry the Ring.&quot;</P>

<P>He laid Boromir’s body gently in one of the boats and then unstrapped the greaves from around his forearms.  That done, he pushed the boat off from the bank towards the waterfall.  We stood, heads bowed, for a moment, marking the passage of a worthy warrior from this world with our silence.</P>

<P>Aragorn broke away first, turning to sit on a nearby rock while he put on Boromir’s greaves.  It was then that I noticed one of the other boats was missing.  I glanced up sharply, scanning the river, and saw with horror that Frodo and Sam were on the other side.  I immediately grabbed the one remaining boat and pushed it into the water.</P>

<P>&quot;Hurry!&quot; I cried to the other two.  &quot;Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.&quot;</P>

<P>There was no movement from my companions.  I paused in my hasty preparations and looked back at where Aragorn still sat on the rock.  I had never seen him so worn down by cares and my heart ached at the despair in his eyes.  He looked out across the river and sighed deeply.</P>

<P>&quot;You mean not to follow them,&quot; said, making it a statement rather than a question as I realised his intentions.</P>

<P>&quot;Frodo’s fate is no longer in our hands,&quot; he replied.</P>

<P>&quot;Then it has all been in vain,&quot; Gimli cried.  &quot;The Fellowship has failed.&quot;</P>

<P>As if Gimli’s words had snapped him out of his own despair, Aragorn rose from the rock and came over to us.  I could see him pulling himself together as he approached, and it was the determined, charismatic Aragorn of old who placed one hand on each of our shoulders.</P>

<P>&quot;Not if we stay true to each other,&quot; he said, looking at Gimli.  Then he turned his gaze upon me and our eyes met for a long moment.  I do not know what it was that I saw in his face, but I knew then that I would follow him wherever he led me, and would rather die than let him down.  My spirits lifted and I felt my own resolve building up again as Aragorn continued, &quot;We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.  Not while we have strength left.&quot;</P>

<P>He broke away from us and began to collect up some belongings.  &quot;Leave all that can be spared behind.  We travel light.&quot;  Then he looked back over his shoulder at us, a fierce glint in his eye.  &quot;Let’s hunt some orc.&quot;</P>

<P>I exchanged a decisive glance with Gimli, who grinned and cried, &quot;Yes!&quot; before setting off through the trees behind Aragorn.  I smiled at his renewed enthusiasm, gathered up my own, and went after them, as we began the next stage of our journey.</P>

<P>END OF PART ONE.</P>
