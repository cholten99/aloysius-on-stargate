<P>Remus rode away from Hogwarts in the carriage Dumbledore had provided, with a heavy heart.  He had very much enjoyed teaching Defence Against The Dark Arts at the school, and now it was over – but that was not what was weighing on his mind the most.  Finding out that Sirius was innocent had been the happiest moment Remus had experienced in twelve long years, but now Sirius was gone too, and the happiness had been placed by guilt and regret.  Their mutual requests and offers of forgiveness in the shack the night before had been far too flippant to erase the jumble of hurt and confusion that was now swirling through Remus’ mind, and he dearly wished that Sirius was by his side now so that he could talk it all through with his friend.</P>

<P>Now that he knew the truth, he couldn’t understand how he could have believed that his oldest friend and the only man he had ever truly loved was a murderer.  All the hate he had felt towards Sirius while he was in Azkaban had immediately transferred itself to Peter, but now Remus felt he had betrayed his friend just as badly as he had believed Sirius had betrayed him all those years ago.</P>

<P>Remus’ thoughts were interrupted by the carriage’s arrival at The Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade, where he would be staying the night.  The Hogwarts Express would be leaving Hogsmeade Station for London the following day but the last thing Remus wanted to do was share the journey with all his erstwhile students.  The problem was, he didn’t know what he wanted to do now.  The only decent job he had ever been offered was now closed to him and he had nowhere else to go.  Once again, he was homeless, friendless and in despair.</P>

<P>Remus dumped his luggage in his room and, unable to settle, set back out into the darkening evening.  Mercifully, the moon was now on the wane so he was in no danger of transforming, but that did little to improve his mood.  Now that he was leaving Hogwarts, he would no longer have access to Snape’s potion-making skills and would have to go back to locking himself away to suffer two days of rabid hunger and self-mutilation once a month.</P>

<P>Without realising where he was going, Remus found himself at the boundary separating the Shrieking Shack from the surrounding woodland.  He gazed at the ramshackle building, remembering all the time he had spent there in his youth, and also that brief ecstatic moment the night before when Sirius had been in his arms again.</P>

<P>The trees rustled and suddenly Remus was knocked off his feet from behind.  He rolled onto his back, reaching for his want, but before he could defend himself he felt his arms pinned to the ground and a rough tongue rasping at the side of his face.  Spluttering, Remus pushed the huge black dog away and propped himself up on his elbows.</P>

<P>&quot;Padfoot!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;What on earth are you doing here?&quot;</P>

<P>In answer, the dog trotted up to the gate in the fence around the shack, stopped and looked back at Remus, his intention clear.  Remus pushed himself to his feet, glanced carefully around to check that there was nobody else in the area, then followed the dog up the path to the battered door.  It was as if his prayers had been answered; here was Sirius right before him, just as he’d wanted, but suddenly he was apprehensive.  What could they say to one another that would repair the breach in their friendship?</P>

<P>Remus opened the door and the dog preceded him into the shadowy building, heading for the room in which the previous night’s confrontation had occurred.  Cautious of alerting the Hogsmead inhabitants to their presence, Remus resisted the temptation to create some light.  When he entered the room, Sirius was sitting on the bed, looking up at him.  The night before, everything had happened so fast that Remus hadn’t really noticed how his friend had changed.  It was difficult to believe that the vibrant young man with whom he had shared his youth was the same person as the dirty and bedraggled man here now.  The tattered clothes, grimy skin and lack of a good haircut were easy to look past; it was the deeper alterations that made Remus’ heart ache.  Sirius was painfully thin, his hands shook as he ran them through his matted hair, and the eyes that stared up at Remus were shadowed by sorrow.</P>

<P>Remus crossed the room and knelt down in front of his friend, reaching out a hand towards the ravaged face, but stopping short before his finger touched skin.</P>

<P>&quot;How can you ever forgive me?&quot; he asked, his voice breaking.</P>

<P>Before he could say anything else, Sirius grabbed his hand and clutched it tightly, holding Remus’ gaze with his own, which was hard and uncompromising.</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t do this, Remus,&quot; he said, his voice harsh and cracked.  &quot;Listen to me – I won’t say this again.  Back then, it was impossible to tell who could be trusted and who could not.  Voldemort controlled a lot of people, and it was my own mistrust that led to me not telling you Peter and I had switched as Secret Keeper.  I don’t blame you for believing what appeared to be true, as I hope you don’t blame me for my misplaced fear of confiding in you.  We both made a mess of things, and James and Lily paid the price.  But what’s done is done – we can’t change it with regret.&quot;  His face softened slightly.  &quot;I need you, Remus.  Can you let go of your guilt and love me as you once did?&quot;</P>

<P>A huge weight lifted from Remus’ heart at these words and he smiled.  &quot;I can do that,&quot; he said.  Then he grew serious again.  &quot;I assume you’ll be leaving the country with Buckbeak in tow.  What do you need me to do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Come with me,&quot; Sirius replied simply, hope brightening his features for the first time.</P>

<P>&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Remus asked.  &quot;You really want me with you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I really do,&quot; Sirius said, his rough fingers stroking across Remus’ knuckles.  &quot;It won’t be easy.  We’ll have to cut ourselves off from the wizarding community and go into hiding.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don’t care about that,&quot; Remus said immediately.  &quot;What have I got to stay here for?  Enforced unemployment, prejudice, uselessness.  Of course I’ll come with you.&quot;</P>

<P>But Sirius shook his head.  &quot;You don’t understand what I’m asking of you,&quot; he continued.  &quot;It’s not just the danger of capture you’ll have to endure.  I’ve changed, Remus.  Azkaban – the Dementors…  I’m not the same person I was before.&quot;</P>

<P>Remus extricated his hands from Sirius’ grip and brought them up to frame the other man’s face.  &quot;I’ve changed too,&quot; he said.  &quot;But the people we were are still inside us somewhere.  We’ll find each other again.&quot;</P>

<P>THE END</P>
