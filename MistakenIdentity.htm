casting clods of earth into the air as they ran.<span style="mso-spacerun:

the treeline, waiting until Sam, Teal’c and Daniel had passed him before
resuming his flight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Seconds later,
they all reached the Stargate and flung themselves down behind the

unnecessarily as he, Sam and Teal’c laid down cover fire back the way they had
come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No-one had followed them out into
the open, which gave them no fixed targets, but hopefully meant they would be
able to escape through the Stargate without taking anyone with them.<span

to punch each symbol in turn whenever a break in the enemy fire presented the
opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had managed to enter
four chevrons when something small and spherical came flying across the field
in a graceful arc and landed directly at his feet.<span style="mso-spacerun:

them all like a physical blow, sending them sprawling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

two enemy soldiers standing over him, their weapons trained unerringly on his
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of them kicked his gun away,
and he saw three other pairs of soldiers doing the same to the rest of his
team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sam and Teal’c exchanged
frustrated glances with him, but Daniel lay motionless where he had fallen next
to the DHD.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

approached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was clearly the leader
of their captors, since he barked something unintelligible at the soldiers
standing over Daniel and they immediately grabbed the unconscious archaeologist
and lifted him up between them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The leader,
who was bareheaded and wore elaborate robes rather than helmet and armour,
stepped up to the DHD and punched in a destination.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Jack craned to see the combination of symbols, but the man
carefully shielded the panel from view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking back to Daniel, however, he saw that the younger man was aware
again and watching the DHD intently, while trying not to let the men holding
him realise he was awake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A wormhole
formed in the ring of the Stargate with its usual outward surge, then settled
into a shimmering wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

briefly to press something on the stone surrounding the DHD and the whole
device suddenly descended into the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A slab of stone slid out over it, sealing it from view.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then the man strode up to the event horizon
and vanished into it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the two
soldiers started to drag Daniel up the steps to the gate, Jack cried, “No!” and
surged to his feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His resistance was
short-lived, however, as one of the soldiers next to him struck him a vicious
blow to the side of his knee and he fell back to the ground with a curse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remaining soldiers quickly followed, backing rapidly away from their prisoners,
and keeping their weapons carefully aimed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

gate but, predictably, the wormhole dissipated just before he reached its
threshold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

blocked our view most effectively.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
crossed back to where Jack was still sitting on the ground and offered him a
hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once on his feet, Jack tried to
put weight on his injured leg and swore again as it gave way beneath him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With Teal’c’s help, he limped carefully over
to the steps leading up to the Stargate and sat down again.<span

kit and kneeling down at his feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jack
lifted up his pant leg to see that his knee was already swelling, and started
thinking out loud while Sam wrapped the injury.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unknown Stargate location and we’re stuck here with no DHD so we can’t get back
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We won’t be missed back on Earth
for another twenty-three hours and, even when they send help, the chances of
finding Daniel are pretty minimal.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He
glanced round at the remaining members of his team, both of whom were regarding
him with sombre expressions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Now that

decisively, “let’s figure out how to get out of it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his jacket, his glasses and his boots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

to be the source of his discomfort, and he was rather disconcerted to discover
that a metal collar had been locked in place around his neck.<span

his surroundings, Daniel noted that the light in the room was coming from a
square panel high in the ceiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
walls were sheer and did not appear to have any seams in them at all, but
Daniel started inspecting them anyway, just in case there was a flaw or opening
he couldn’t immediately spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was
half way through feeling his way over the third wall when a sound behind him
made him turn to discover that a section of the opposite wall had suddenly slid
back to reveal a man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The stranger
stepped into the room and was followed by another man, this one clearly a
soldier, judging by his armour and the weapon he aimed at Daniel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the ancient Greeks, which fitted with the architecture Daniel remembered seeing
on the planet, as well as the language he had heard the soldiers using before
they had attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first man spoke
and it took Daniel a few moments to dredge up his knowledge of ancient Greek
and work out what he had said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I have

Goa’uld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the planet, he had
attempted his usual peaceful greeting, but the soldiers had attacked them as
soon as they had seen Teal’c, so they must have assumed that the rest of SG-1
were Goa’uld and acted accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If
they were enemies of the Goa’uld then they might be potential allies of Earth
and willing to release Daniel once the misunderstanding had been cleared
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Daniel’s Greek was rather rusty,
