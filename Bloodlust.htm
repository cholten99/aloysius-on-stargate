<P>Blood drips from my mouth as I crouch over the body of a young man.  No dainty pair of puncture wounds in the side of the neck for me – this victim’s throat has been ripped clean out.  Gobs of flesh scatter the road around his head where I have spat them out, but there is little of his blood that I have allowed to go to waste.</P>

<P>I have slaked my thirst this night, and the beast within that drives me to kill like this is no longer baying for sustenance.  Soon, as the day approaches, it will be quiescent once more but now, in the glorious hours after I have fed, I will revel in the power and strength the blood of this young man has given me.  I do not fear the hunger that comes upon me each night, nor do it despise it – it is what I live for, this otherworldly addiction that takes my mind and body to another level.</P>

<P>I rise from my kill, unconcerned about concealing my actions, and climb the side of the nearest building.  I feel the other’s blood coursing through me, awakening my own and filling me with a fierce joy in the night.  I run through the city, leaping from roof to roof as I make my frenzied journey home.</P>

<P>This is my freedom, this my purpose.  The daily toil of mundane existence, one lost among thousands of identical drones, is merely an unpleasant necessity.  I pity those for whom that is all life has to offer.</P>

<P>They will never know the taste of freedom, never share the joy of death.</P></FONT></BODY>
