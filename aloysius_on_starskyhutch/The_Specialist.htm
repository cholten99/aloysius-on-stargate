Opening shot of Hutch without a shirt, brushing his beautful hair - YUM!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
The weirdness of Starsky's brain strikes again with his 'what if' line of thought. I just love the boggled expression on Hutch's face when he utters the line "If my name had been Anderson, I might have been a doctor." Starsky's reasoning sort of has a bizarre logic to it, and you can see Hutch is trying to get it to make sense in his head, but I'm not sure he manages it!<BR>
<BR>
Another idiotic woman - she hears gunshots, sees armed men running out of a building, so she steps *out* into the street to get a better view.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is looking particularly spiffy in this episode - the black leather jacket he wears throughout the first half is lovely.<BR>
<BR>
Their trick of taking the bad guy by surprise by Hutch dragging Starsky into the room is pretty cool, but Starsky does look rather heavy and it doesn't leave either of them in a good position to react very quickly.<BR>
<BR>
I love it when they do their "are you thinking what I'm thinking" thing - especially when they don't actually discuss what they're thinking about, just assuming the other one is on the same wave length.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's "I'm being really serious here" voice is great - it's slightly lower than normal, and he enunciates every word extremely forcefully. I know *I'd* be scared if he turned it on me, so it's no surprise that it gets to the government agency guy.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky certainly has an interesting way of watching TV - sitting on the floor with one foot up on a bed on either side doesn't look too comfortable to me. He doesn't move from that position throughout the entire scene, so I'm guessing he got stuck!<BR>
<BR>
We get a lovely look at Starsky's furry abs, too - this is a great ep! The bullet-proof vests they wear don't look particularly effective, if you ask me, though.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch really is rather keen on forward rolls, isn't he? And he throws himself into them with such enthusiasm - it's a wonder he doesn't hurt himself!<BR>
<BR>
They are so mean to poor Sally, so I'm glad she gets her revenge at the end. However, if I had the chance to take S+H home with me, I don't think I'd spend the evening beating them up!<BR>
