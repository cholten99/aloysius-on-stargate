</B><P><BR>
I'd been waiting to see this episode for four months, ever since I found out what happened in it by reading fanfic just as Season 1 started airing in the UK.</P>
<P><BR>
A bad guy whose hand is the only thing we see for the majority of the first scene has got to be a supervillain of the first order! It's a bit of an anti-climax when he's finally revealed as the bloke from Targets Without A Badge, but hey...<BR>
<BR>
Only S+H would play ping pong in the bullpen when it's being decorated! This scene is wonderfully carefree - a brilliant build-up to what happens next.<BR>
<BR>
I already knew what was going to happen, but that only heightened the tension so that as S+H came out of the building and made their way over to the Torino, I was practically hyperventilating! Then it all happened way too fast and suddenly I was watching crappy daytime commercials for bank loans and car insurance. If I hadn't been expecting Starsky to get shot, I have no idea what my reaction would have been, but I imagine it would have been similar to Hutch's.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch sitting on the chair with his face right up against the window of Starsky's hospital room is positively heartbreaking.<BR>
<BR>
Dobey: Calm down and wait until I find you a new partner.<BR>
Hutch: I've already got a partner. I don't need another one.<BR>
Dobey really should have known better than to say that!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's subsequent speech to Huggy in the elevator is incredibly, especially because of its juxtaposition to his vehement denial to Dobey. I love the almost smile he manages as he gives Dobey's car keys to Huggy.<BR>
<BR>
Considering he knows the hitmen were after both of them, Hutch isn't very careful in the hospital parking garage, is he? But he's most definitely in psychotic determination mode when he actually gets attacked!<BR>
<BR>
Is it me, or does it take the nurse a *ridiculously* long time to call the code blue on Starsky? I was practically screaming at her to do something by the time she finally sounded the alarm!<BR>
<BR>
I love the shot of Hutch bouncing the ping pong ball on top of the telephone, as if he's clinging on to the memory of when he last saw Starsky whole and well. The subsequent shot of the ball abandoned on the table and Hutch having left so fast he didn't even hang up the phone is brilliant.<BR>
<BR>
The second Hutch enters the hospital, Starsky's heart starts beating again - it doesn't get much better than that!<BR>
<BR>
The fact that Dobey won't eat is so sweet, and I love Huggy trying to persuade him. They make unlikely comforters for each other, but they are perfectly brought together by their shared concern for S+H.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch pouring out his despair to Starsky is wonderful, and his unbridled joy at Starsky waking up is so lovely. He's really cute when he wants to share his findings on the case with Starsky, and Starsky's obvious amusement at his boisterous partner is pretty cute, too.<BR>
<BR>
The arrest of Gunther is a bit abrupt if you ask me, but seeing S+H giggling in bed together is absolutely fantastic! The party in Starsky's room is hilarious, too.<BR>
<BR>
What a brilliant ending to a great show!<BR>
