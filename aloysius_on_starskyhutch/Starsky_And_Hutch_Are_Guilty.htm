Classic opening conversation between the guys that totally sums up their friendship:<BR>
Starsky: Do you trust me or not?<BR>
Hutch: With my life? Yes. With your choice of women? No.<BR>
<BR>
I love the way they line up in front of Captain Ryan like naughty schoolboys. Hutch even jiggles Starsky's arm as if he's trying to wind him up - it's very adolescent, but cute all the same.<BR>
<BR>
The premise is a clever idea on the part of the bad guys - it's good to see some imagination from Bay City's criminal masterminds. It does highlight the problem with having such a conspicuous car, though - the lookalikes don't really look that much like our boys, but it's believable that people just see the car and assume it's them.<BR>
<BR>
The 'rousting' of the hookers is pretty funny. I notice Starsky gestures for Hutch to sit on the solitary chair while he plants himself comfortably on the sofa in between the two blondes - though of course it's Hutch who gets offered Nicky's new address, so I guess he gets his own back.<BR>
<BR>
I love the telephone conversation they have when Hutch finds the money Starsky has supposedly dropped off at his apartment:<BR>
Starsky: [exasperated because Hutch has interrupted him kissing Sharon] Whaddya want?<BR>
Hutch: [all business] Starsk, did you stop by my house about an hour ago?<BR>
Starsky: What, are you crazy? I was with you!<BR>
Hutch: No, I'm not crazy. Neither are you. And we're both in big trouble.<BR>
<BR>
It's a shame Sharon turns out to be corrupt - she seemed sweet in her first scene, and Starsky seems quite keen on her. I guess I should have known from that she'd either die or be a baddie!<BR>
<BR>
I thought I'd seen some bad clothes in this show, but the outfits S+H wear to the hospital blow all the others right out of the water! Where do they find these clothes? Their act is very funny, though - and worryingly cute! I love the fact that the nurse is completely immune to their cheesy come-on lines, too.<BR>
<BR>
The way they sneak around the PD pretending to clean is hilarious! I imagine they'd probably draw less attention to themselves if they just strolled in wearing their normal clothes, but that would be no fun.<BR>
<BR>
The double Torino chase is brilliant - I love the way the despatcher says, "But that's Starsky's car" when Hutch is trying to explain the situation!<BR>
<BR>
Lots of funny moments, and both guys are very cute when they're confused, so they're pretty cute throughout most of this episode.<BR>
