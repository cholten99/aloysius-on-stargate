(These observations are as noted whilst watching for the first time, which will explain the apparent lack of knowledge of what happens in the later parts of the episode...)<BR>
<BR>
S+H on stakeout is pretty much as I would have expected. The banter is right on form. I can just imagine Starsky failing to do card tricks for five hours and Hutch getting more and more annoyed with him.<BR>
<BR>
I quite like Lionel - he's certainly a cut above S+H's normal brand of informant, and he's also pretty cute.<BR>
<BR>
The DA's cool, too - this is a good ep for minor characters.<BR>
<BR>
In the scene with the DA in Dobey's office, Hutch has got a new jacket - and it's *gorgeous*. It looks great with the black shirt and tight jeans, by far the nicest clothes he's worn in a long, long time - YUMMY!<BR>
<BR>
Showing Lionel's family is a nastily effective way of getting the viewer attached to him. His wife and daughter are really lovely - I have a very bad feeling about this...<BR>
<BR>
I love Starsky's expression when Hutch calls the femals judge 'sir', and Hutch is ever so cute when he starts stammering under pressure on the witness stand.<BR>
<BR>
It's never a good sign when S+H are forced to expose someone by their superiors - I have a *very* bad feeling about this, and I see major guilt trips ahead.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing Dobey into the circle of guilt by Lionel's wife confronting him is clever, too. They're really setting this one up for a huge fall - by this stage I'm absolutely certain Lionel's not going to make it to the end of the episode, and the hints are getting a bit heavy handed.<BR>
<BR>
The hitman isn't exactly inconspicuous in that silver jacket, is he?<BR>
<BR>
Starsky dashing down to check on Hutch after the car explodes is really cute - but I do think leaving Lionel alone is a bit stupid. I guess it's par for the course that Starsky won't be able to think straight if he thinks Hutch is hurt, though.<BR>
<BR>
And it's bye-bye Lionel - no surprise there, but still very sad. The guilt and blame certainly gets spread around after his death - a bit heavy, this! The bit with Huggy and Lionel's daughter is a step too far, if you ask me.<BR>
<BR>
Then we get the famous beach scene - and it's even better than I was expecting! Wow - what a scene. Best show of solidarity between S+H we've ever seen - fantastic stuff.<BR>
<BR>
And if that wasn't enough, we then get a cliffhanger of people trying to kill S+H, including one of Hutch's brilliant leaps into the moving Torino. Exciting, or what?<BR>
<BR>
This is looking to be a really good build up to the finale.<BR>
