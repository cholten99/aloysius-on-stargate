</B><P><BR>
It opens with a classic head in hands moment for Hutch when Starsky does a 180 on his opinion of camping at the appearance of a pretty girl. I love the expression Hutch gets when he's despairing of his partner's antics. I like the idea that they go on vacation together, too.<BR>
<BR>
Then we get classic stupid undercover personas, the usual name confusion, along with Starsky's characteristic penchant for shorts and the most hideous shirt I've ever seen on Hutch. So far, so silly!<BR>
<BR>
The switch from idiot trash collectors to serious discussion of the case as soon as the secret police chief leaves is brilliant - they really are very good, aren't they?<BR>
<BR>
The clothes don't improve a huge amount on the golf course, though the open shirts and shorts combo does reveal some lovely chest and thigh! Even better is the river crossing scene, though Hutch looks like he could use a higher factor sun screen.<BR>
<BR>
I like the shipwrecked bit at the start of part two - very sexy! They spend an awful lot of time half naked and wet in this episode!!<BR>
<BR>
Papa Theodore's obviously a slash fan, judging by what he does with the dolls of S+H...<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's obvious concern for Starsky is very sweet, especially when he suggests they rest at the end of their climb and pretends he needs to tie his shoe.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: Are you alright?<BR>
Starsky: Yeah.<BR>
Hutch: You just tried to kill me.<BR>
Starsky: What are you talking about?<BR>
Hutch: It's okay. It's alright. You didn't hurt me.<BR>
Awwwww! How cute is that?<BR>
<BR>
It's usually Hutch who habitually touches Starsky, but here it's Starsky's turn to keep a hand on Hutch as they make their way over the rocks for the second time. It's a nice way to demonstrate that Starsky is now completely free of Papa Theodore's influence, and it continues all the way past the fort.<BR>
<BR>
The tag is quite cute - it's nice to see that Hutch is susceptible to superstition too.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, pretty good fun.<BR>
</P>
