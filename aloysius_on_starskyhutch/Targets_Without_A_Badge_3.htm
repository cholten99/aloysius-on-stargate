</B><P><BR>
I have to admit to being thoroughly confused by the mix of the McClelland storyline, the Thomas May storyline and this new bizarre mortgage thing with Huggy - maybe I've not been concentrating properly, but I have *no* idea what's going on by the start of Part 3.<BR>
<BR>
It's a real shame Starsky was wearing underwear in the steam room - I got quite excited for a moment when his towel fell off!<BR>
<BR>
I like the fact that Huggy attempts to clarify things slightly by re-iterating where McClelland fits in when Hutch spots his name on the letterhead - this plot is just confusing enough that I might have forgotten who he was!<BR>
<BR>
What is with Hutch's stupid cowboy hat? He complains about being seen in the pimp's car but he actually fits pretty well with the image in that hat!<BR>
<BR>
Next comment written as I was watching, and before I knew what happens later: Clayburn's great - I love him, he's such a sweetie! [For a reviewer, noted for her observational skills, I'm really not that bright...]<BR>
<BR>
Soldier: Judge McClelland?<BR>
McClelland: Yes, what can I do for you?<BR>
Soldier: Die!!<BR>
It's a classic! Corny, cliched, but brilliant.<BR>
<BR>
The teamwork in rescuing Alison is great. Hutch isn't even in on the plan, but he reacts at just the right moment and follows along perfectly. Excellent action sequence.<BR>
<BR>
The twist is revealed, eliciting a cry of shock and disappointment from me: Oh no! I really liked Clayburn! They really played me well on that one - I can't believe I had no idea he was a baddie. Shame - he was cute!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch makes excellent use of the raised index finger and assertive attitude on Clayburn's secretary - I certainly wouldn't want to get on his bad side. He's very intimidating when he wants to be.<BR>
<BR>
S+H are losing informants, witnesses and suspects all over the place - the body count is really piling up by the end of this one!<BR>
<BR>
Alison sums things up perfectly at the end, though:<BR>
Alison: Well, I think you are both wonderful!<BR>
<BR>
My sentiments exactly!<BR>
<BR>
Who cares if I haven't got a sausage of a clue what actually happened? S+H were wonderful, and that's all that matters...<BR>
