It's always fun when Starsky gets the opportunity to wind up Hutch for a change, so the scene in Dobey's office when Hutch is trying to get a lift to the hospital is great. I love the bit at the hospital where Starsky tells Hutch to be brave, and the way Hutch immediately shifts from being totally pathetic to overly macho when the nurse comes in is so typically male!<BR>
<BR>
Then we get lots and lots of lovely Hutch skin. Mmmmmm... Excuse me for a moment while I drool...<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to refrain from commenting on Starsky's dancing... Suffice it to say that's one of the scenes that reminds me this is a 70s show...<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is very cute when he's trying to let Diana down easy - the mixture of confusion and exasperation is adorable, and I love the fact that he doesn't want to hurt her feelings despite her bizarre behaviour.<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Hutch wanders round his vandalised apartment picking up all the plants - he really is very fond of them, isn't he?<BR>
<BR>
Model ship building seems like a strange hobby for Starsky to have - I wouldn't have thought he'd have the patience for it.<BR>
<BR>
The bust is brilliant, and Starsky's postively on fire, leaping on top of the car to grab Frost as he tries to run away. This is a great sequence.<BR>
<BR>
The nearest black and white to Hutch's place can't have been very close, since Starsky still gets there first. I'm not complaining, though, because otherwise we wouldn't get the ubiquitous hug, which as usual is lovely.<BR>
<BR>
The tag is cute, too - it's not surprising that the famous Hutchinson index finger doesn't work at all on Starsky, and I love the shift in Hutch's expression from smiling at Dobey to glaring at Starsky.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, I like this episode a lot - it's got funny bits, cute bits, clever bits, and the general over-riding sense of partnership between S+H that makes the show as a whole so good.<BR>
