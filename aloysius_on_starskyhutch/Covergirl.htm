</B><P><BR>
The telephone conversation at the beginning is brilliant - I love the way Hutch takes down all the details of the report in a completely professional manner and then rolls his eyes after he puts the phone down.<BR>
<BR>
The banter when Starsky arrives seems rather flat, though. I have no problem with their teasing of each other being predictable - that's part of the fun - but Hutch sounds almost bored when he responds to Starsky's comment about his face being numb by suggesting that losing half his face would only be an improvement. The fact that he knows Starsky's been to the dentist because he's brought a magazine to work is a cute demonstration of how well they know each other, though, and the way Starsky leans against Hutch’s leg throughout is lovely.<BR>
<BR>
Dobey sending them out ten minutes before the end of their shift is really evil, and I just love the way he chuckles as they leave - it's always fun to see him giving as good as he gets.<BR>
<BR>
I like the contrast between Angel and Jimmy, and Angel's observations about the world are really interesting - he's a good character.<BR>
<BR>
I like the way Hutch says "That's good" when Dobey tells him Starsky is with the injured cop's family - shows he has faith in his partner's ability to be a comfort to them, which is sweet.<BR>
<BR>
The connection between the case they're working on and Kate's self-imposed assassination, via the hitman, is clever - neat but not too contrived.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's surprised pleasure at seeing Kate again is wonderfully sincere. For just a moment, his beauty manages to shine through from underneath all that hair and I can fall in love with him again - but sadly the off-putting mustache regains control very quickly.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: [at Kate's reluctance to speak] Starsky's my partner. It's okay.<BR>
<BR>
I like the way he includes Starsky, and the way he immediately looks over at Starsky when Kate tells them why she's there is great - partner solidarity all the way.<BR>
<BR>
Angel is a man of interesting contrasts - classical music and meticulous dress sense versus killing people for a living, fiddling with toys versus fiddling with bombs. He's a well drawn and engaging character.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's intimidation of Jimmy is brilliant - I just love him when he's in hard cop mode. Very intense and sexy - and since Hutch grew the hideous mustache, I'm directing all my devotion at Starsky so I've got to take my thrills where I can get them! Fickle? Who, me? Never!<BR>
<BR>
The difference in drinks - beer straight from the can versus wine from a crystal glass - is a clever way to demonstrate the differences between Kate and Hutch. Effective and subtle characterisation.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: I don't know how you could even consider death before it comes. Life is all we've got! Whatever the circumstances.<BR>
</P>
<P>Great lines - and a philosophy I share myself. Even with the mustache, he's still a great guy!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch may indirectly praise Starsky's comforting skills earlier on, but he's not so bad in that department himself:<BR>
<BR>
Kate: I think I love you.<BR>
Hutch: I think you're scared.<BR>
Kate: I think you're right. Will you kiss me?<BR>
Hutch: Not a chance. [Leans in and kisses her.]<BR>
<BR>
Great scene - and Hutch looks like a very nice kisser, despite the mustache. (Uh-oh! My preference is wavering again - though I'm not sure the mustache can ever really be overcome.)<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's sudden radio call of "Turkey Buzzard! Turkey Buzzard! This is Chicken Little. Do you read me?" is so unexpected and so at odds with the atmosphere of the scene, it's hilarious! And where on earth do they get their codenames from???<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: [on getting no response from Hutch on the radio] Hey, bozo, the sky is falling and if you don't answer me, I'm gonna come over there and mess up your roof!<BR>
<BR>
LOLOL! Starsky's just brilliant!<BR>
<BR>
Classic concern and physical contact from Starsky after Hutch nearly gets blown up by the car - excellent stuff.<BR>
<BR>
The interaction between Starsky and Minnie is great - another brilliant character, and more than a match for Starsky. I love the flirty, teasing dynamic of their relationship.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's knowing observation that Kate and Hutch are both wet is really cute, as are their giggly grins back at him. They do make a good couple - says the confirmed slasher! What's wrong with me today? First I'm managing to ignore my hatred of the mustache, and now I'm thinking Hutch looks good with a *girl*!!! The sky is indeed falling!<BR>
<BR>
I love it when Hutch leaps through the window of the moving Torino - it's so cool!<BR>
<BR>
More unspoken concern and physical contact when Hutch nearly gets blown up a second time - good ep for that!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's reluctance to have his photo taken is very cute.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, a great episode in the midst of the so far uninspiring Season Four.<BR>
<BR>
