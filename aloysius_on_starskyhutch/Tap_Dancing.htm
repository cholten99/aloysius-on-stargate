Okay, first question - when were they supposed to have left our hearts? Didn't spot that happening!<BR>
<BR>
I had to do two double takes, as well as nearly choking on a sausage, at the start of this one. Starsky seems to find Hutch's bumbling Texan routine almost as funny as I do, but his accent as Ramon is even worse!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch talking to himself in Marcia's apartment is really cute - "What have you got yourself into, Hutchinson?" - and I'm impressed at how well he stays in character when Marcia kisses him. The undercover policeman's life sure is a hard one, isn't it? (Incredibly bad pun entirely intentional...)<BR>
<BR>
The morning after scene is hilarious, and a slightly ruffled Hutch is extremely cute, but the dirty look Starsky gives him is brilliant.<BR>
<BR>
Idiot woman number four thousand three hundred and two starts off suspicion amongst the bad guys, but 'Ramon' and 'Charlie' meeting Dobey outside in broad daylight isn't exactly smart, either!<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Starsky keeps practising his dance moves all over the place, and it's cute that he's wearing Hutch's cowboy hat in the scene where they discuss the trade on the docks.<BR>
<BR>
Using a pick-up truck to try and run a cab off a pier doesn't seem like the best way to kill two cops if you ask me...<BR>
<BR>
Watching Starsky 'dip' Hutch at the end must be every slasher's dream. And as far as I can tell, there's a fair amount of jealousy displayed by both of them in this episode - Starsky's obvious annoyance at Hutch sleeping with Marcia surely has slashy origins, and Hutch's attempt to brush off Ramon's populariy with mockery at the end doesn't fool me for a second!<BR>
<BR>
