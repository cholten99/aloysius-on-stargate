Starsky is really cute in his enthusiasm for the watch, and Hutch's attempts to ruin it by criticising the watch are characteristically mean, but also quite funny.<BR>
<BR>
Huggy: Starsky, if your other half is there, I'd like to meet with the whole package.<BR>
Very cool line!<BR>
<BR>
When they arrive at The Pits, Hutch gets out of the Torino, turns the wrong way, catches himself and then does an about face to get to the door - weird!<BR>
<BR>
Huggy referring to Hutch as "Mr America" is great - another nickname coined, though Hutch's reaction to it is quite interesting. He slides his eyes across to Starsky, keeping his expression carefully neutral, as if he's trying to gauge Starsky's reaction, which unforunately we don't get to see.<BR>
<BR>
Joey and her mother create a fun interlude. S+H clearly don't know how to react to such a blase attitude from a mother! Joey stowing away in the car adds an interesting dimension to the rest of the ep, too.<BR>
<BR>
I love the bit where Starsky's watch alarm goes off - he's so pleased it works, and Hutch's withering look is classic!<BR>
<BR>
The baddies' plan is pretty good - it certainly works well enough to get S+H trapped in the barn. It's always good when a bad guy has the patience to plan properly, but of course it's always their insistence on making their revenge symbolic that ultimately leads to their downfall.<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Starsky still keeps firing even after he's been shot, as they scramble back into the barn. His aim looks a bit dodgy, but I guess we can forgive that considering the circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is really good at taking charge.<BR>
"I'm gonna get you out of here, too, partner."<BR>
"I've got to get you to a doctor."<BR>
He seems to thrive on situations where he has to take care of Starsky - it ratchets all his instincts up a notch. He suddenly gets galvanised into action and starts zipping about all over the place, trying to get the tractor started.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's attitude to the situation totally changes, too, in counterpoint to Starsky's sudden pessimism.<BR>
Starsky: Hey, uh, in case this thing doesn't work out...<BR>
Hutch: Are you kidding me? This is the best plan I ever had!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch goes one too far in the meanness stakes at the end, though, if you ask me. Kicking away Starsky's cane and making him fall over really is below the belt!<BR>
<BR>
