Only Starsky could look adorable standing in a dumpster covered in trimmings!<BR>
<BR>
Fashion Show Woman: [about Starsky] He's cute.<BR>
Hutch: I don't think so.<BR>
What's that about? He says it in a really weird tone, too, though I can't figure out what it is. Is he really saying, "Not compared to me", "Hands off, he's mine" or does he really not think Starsky's cute?<BR>
<BR>
Laura's weird - funny, but weird...<BR>
<BR>
The scene in the Torino outside the bar has pretty much all the elements that make S+H who they are rolled into one conversation:<BR>
"We're buddies, right? Trust me!"<BR>
Hutch being mean - sending Starsky into the bar on his own.<BR>
Hutch as the intellectual, having to teach Starsky some Spanish.<BR>
Starsky's taste in women being a bone of contention - reference to him setting Hutch up on a bad blind date.<BR>
Teasing with obvious underlying affection.<BR>
<BR>
Then of course we get Hutch speeding to the rescue when he thinks Starsky is getting beaten up - that boy can really move when he wants to!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is his usual touchy-feely self when they get fired upon in the apartment building. He keeps one hand on Starsky until the situation calms down a bit.<BR>
<BR>
S+H beat their silliest undercover act yet again - they do make very convincing mime artists, though. Is there anything these guys can't do?<BR>
<BR>
The tag has Hutch being all grumpy again - jealousy if you ask me (though he's clearly not interested in Laura...). I love the fact that he can predict Starsky's bad jokes, though.<BR>
<BR>
