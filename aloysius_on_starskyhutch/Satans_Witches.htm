How on Earth did Hutch persuade Starsky to go on vacation with him to a cabin in the middle of nowhere! The way they bicker on the way up is really funny, and very sweet. I love the way they both say exactly the same things about the location when they get there, but Starsky makes it a complaint while Hutch is rejoicing. I have to say I'm with Starsky on this one - give me a shopping centre and a multiplex cinema and I'm a happy woman. Cabins and countryside are a definite no-no!<BR>
<BR>
Of course it's impossible for S+H to go on holiday without something happening, and earning the wrath of a Satanic cult is just about par for the course for them!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is being mean again, but the way he creeps up behind Starsky and tickles him is absolutely brilliant.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is incredibly cute when he's in holiday mode - it's rare that we get to see him so relaxed and happy.<BR>
<BR>
The scene back at the cabin is so wonderfully domestic - Hutch cooking while Starsky 'investigates' the fireplace. This image of them off duty together is great, despite Starsky's complaining.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch really does enjoy winding Starsky up, doesn't he? I have to admit Starsky brandishing the ketchup bottle when he switches the lights back on is hilarious, though!<BR>
<BR>
Then they go out into the night, armed with a spatula and a very small frying pan! They're both very cute when they're nervous.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch tipping Starsky off the couch and then running for it, and Starsky throwing a boot at him and then going back to sleep on the floor is just classic - what a great scene!<BR>
<BR>
I figure if Hutch walks straight past a 'No Trespassing' sign, he pretty much deserves whatever he gets. For a cop, he's not very solicitous of people's rights, is he?<BR>
<BR>
Starsky certainly fills out his underwear rather nicely!<BR>
<BR>
The way Starsky grabs onto Hutch when he's scared is adorable, and their subsequent reaction to the ridiculously attractive Satan worshippers is brilliant. I love the way Starsky leans casually against the wall and then suddenly legs it into the cabin when he realises what he's wearing!<BR>
<BR>
There's another classic exchange of glances when Hutch comes in to find Starsky pinned down by the snake - great moment.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch does at least have the grace to look apologetic when Starsky bemoans their predicament after they get arrested. I assume he then lets Starsky have the top bunk to make up for it!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: What's our plan?<BR>
Hutch: We got none.<BR>
Starsky: That's good.<BR>
LOL!!<BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have quite the same impact when they go tearing away in the LTD, as opposed to the Torino, does it! I guess Starsky refused to risk getting his baby dirty in the nasty woods.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: Watch out for that tree!<BR>
Hutch: What tree? [CRUNCH!}<BR>
LOLOL!!<BR>
<BR>
Does Starsky really say "Holy Cabbage" when they see the Satanists? I've never heard that one before!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: Get him out of position, and lead him into the woods.<BR>
Starsky: To the woods? Why don't you?<BR>
Hutch: Cos I'm gonna save the girl.<BR>
Starsky: Oh. Why don't I?<BR>
Hutch: Cos I thought of it first.<BR>
Ah, the advantages of quick thinking!<BR>
<BR>
Lizzie is remarkably calm and practical for a sixteen-year-old who's been held by a Satanic cult for two days and was about to be wed to Satan in a probably fatal ritual. Good on her for not being hysterical.<BR>
<BR>
The sequence when they clobber the bad guys while Lizzie switches the lights on and off is brilliant - clever and funny!<BR>
<BR>
S+H standing back to back, ready to take on the whole cult together is great.<BR>
<BR>
The tag is really funny, too - Hutch's expression when they hear the bear totally cracked me up.<BR>
<BR>
A wonderfully silly episode - I really enjoyed this one!<BR>
<BR>
