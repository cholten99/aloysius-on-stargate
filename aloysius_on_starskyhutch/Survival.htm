We're off to a good start with a cute scene in the requisition department, and the revelation that Hutch is going undercover - apparently without Starsky, which is an interesting variation on the theme.<BR>
<BR>
I totally relate to Bigelow - I deal with product lists and routes of stores a lot, and I always go by the product code or store number rather than the description. It drives the fieldworkers nuts, but it's the only way to run my projects efficiently!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's expression as he watches Hutch drive into Humphries' place is wonderful - you can tell just how much he hates letting Hutch do the undercover bit on his own.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's flashy New Yorker act is priceless - the gum is just the perfect finishing touch.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky is so cute when he's panicking - the way he runs back and forth, torn between staying with an obviously dazed Hutch and pursuing the bad guy, is really sweet. Once he's decided, he turns into a regular action man, and the way he drops down from the roof of the truck to point his gun in through the window is very cool.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch has very nice hands, as we can see in their close-up during the cooking scene - just an observation!<BR>
<BR>
When Hutch tells the informant he's going to send Starsky out to meet him, I couldn't help but imagine the ensuing telephone conversation. I bet Hutch was planning on being really pathetic and complaining about his headache to get Starsky to go, when really he wanted to stay in for his date!<BR>
<BR>
Yeep! I really wasn't expecting Hutch's car to actually go over the side of the cliff! The big crescendo of music really wasn't necessary, either - I think I'd gathered that this was a somewhat tension-filled moment!<BR>
<BR>
I love that Starsky is immediately worried. His presentation of his case to Dobey is clever, too - he comes out with all the rational logic behind thinking something's happened to Hutch first, when really it's his 'feeling' that's got him worried. The fact that it's the 'feeling' that actually convinces Dobey is really cool - he knows by now that 'feelings' are to be trusted when it comes to these two.<BR>
<BR>
Another one of Starsky's cute little habits gets a showcase here - I love the way he says "Wha-??" when something unexpected happens - it's so adorable!<BR>
<BR>
The scenes with Sonny are a little surreal - I bet Hutch is wondering what on earth else can go wrong at this point. First he gets run off the road, then he's mistaken for a German spy! He's really not having a very good day, is he?<BR>
<BR>
I would have thought the bad guys of Bay City would know better by now than to mess with one of our guys - having to deal with the other one on the warpath surely isn't worth it! All the people in the elevator look rather nervous when Starsky loses it and hits Humphries, and I can't say I really blame them!<BR>
<BR>
I love the slow zoom in the scene where Starsky questions Carla. It really captures Starsky's intensity and determination. And then he describes Hutch as "someone very, very, very close to me" - great line!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's actually pretty scary when he's in 'focused' mode. You can tell when Hutch is really upset because he gets loud and violent, but with Starsky it's when he goes still and quiet that you really need to worry - it's a wonderful contrast of characteristics.<BR>
<BR>
Aren't kids great? They find an injured police officer trapped in a car, so they steal his credit cards.  This is why I quit teaching and decided never to have children...<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Bobby goes a long way towards rectifying the image of youth in the episode, and Starsky's really sweet in his appreciation of the information Bobby gives him. It's nice that he can still be thoughtful to others even when he's fixated on finding Hutch.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky playing up to Sonny's delusion is absolutely wonderful. The earnestness of his expression and the sincerity of his tone when he says Hutch is 'very important' - wow.<BR>
<BR>
Talk about a tense climax! The way it cuts between Humphries on his way to kill Hutch, Starsky on his way to save him, and Hutch himself obviously fading fast, really had my heart in my mouth.<BR>
<BR>
The way Humphries' toupe flies off when Starsky hits him is just brilliant!<BR>
<BR>
And then we get Starsky cradling Hutch's head in his hands and saying, "We made it, partner." I may cry! And it looks as though Starsky's about to join me!<BR>
<BR>
How *cute* is the tag to this episode!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: Aw, Starsk - you know I love ya, but our taste in wheels don't exactly match, you know?<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's salesman patter is adorable, particularly when he says he threw in the faulty horn "because I like your face" - and Hutch's smile right at the end is gorgeous.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't think it was possible for me to love this show and these guys any more than I already did - but this episode proved me wrong!!<BR>
