Mmmm - what lovely legs they both have! I like the idea of them jogging together, and their contrasting attitudes to it are perfectly characterised.<BR>
<BR>
And so yet again Starsky gets himself in a whole lot of trouble over a girl. The guys' track record with women is so abysmal, it's a wonder they don't give up entirely and just stick with each other - wouldn't that be nice?<BR>
<BR>
The Hutch giggle is a wonderful thing - a rare thing, too, but it occurs just after Starsky claims the girl in the park liked him. I'll even forgive him being mean to Starsky, just because he's so adorable when he grins.<BR>
<BR>
I love Hutch's reaction when Starsky says Rosey is special - he's obviously preparing himself for the inevitable fallout, but it's clear his concern is for Starsky and not the case.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch might come on a bit strong when he goes to see Starsky after Rosey finds out he's a cop, but you can tell he really cares underneath the harsh attitude. You can see it in his change in demeanour after Starsky shoves the books off the shelf.<BR>
<BR>
Then we get the wound up Hutch we know and love back in Dobey's office, followed by a full blown index finger and threat of violence combo when they go to confront Chambers and Goodson - the full gamut of Hutch moods and methods is employed in this ep.<BR>
<BR>
I was quite surprised by the ending - Rosey doesn't die *or* turn out to be a baddie, though I guess that isn't much consolation for poor Starsky.<BR>
