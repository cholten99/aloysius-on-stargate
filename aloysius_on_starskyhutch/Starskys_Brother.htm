Hutch gets all the best cases, doesn't he? He was taking a report from a cookie-stealing kid on the phone the other day, and now he gets a wacky, husband-beater who seems to take quite a shine to him! I guess he should just be glad Starsky isn't there to make fun of him.<BR>
<BR>
They certainly cast Starsky's brother well - and the opening interaction between the two of them is brilliant. A very well portrayed sibling relationship.<BR>
<BR>
It figures that since most of Starsky's potential girlfriends turn out to be criminals the same would be true about his brother. The poor guy just never cuts a break, does he?<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's very funny when he's drunk:<BR>
Starsky: You know something? Speaking for myself - at this moment in time, I feel like I'm the only one who is fit to speak for myself, here and now - I think I did pretty good tonight.<BR>
Um, whatever you say, Starsk!<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Hutch keeps his eyes on Starsky during Starsky's diatribe against the feds after the explosion, and then steps in to calm him down at just the right moment with a squeeze of his arms and a few quietly-spoken words.<BR>
<BR>
We get simultaneous finger-pointing from both S+H when they confront Frank in the restaurant - ooh, things are definitely looking bad for the bad guys now!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's speech about Nick's activities and motivations is brilliant, and I like the fact that Starsky actually listens and doesn't shout him down like he does with the feds.<BR>
<BR>
I like that you can tell Hutch is uncomfortable lying to Starsky about going back to Huggy's for his wallet.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: Frankly, I don't give a damn what happens to you, but I do care about what happens to your brother!<BR>
Nice Rhett Butler impression from Hutch here!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's little question session with Nick while he's still tied up is great - I like the way he frantically asks if he's okay, and then starts winding him up once he's checked.<BR>
<BR>
It's a cool tag, too - I love the way Hutch and Huggy gloat and then the tables get turned on them when it turns out the Starsky brothers are hustling them.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, a pretty good episode - interesting insight in Starsky, and some lovely partnership moments.<BR>
