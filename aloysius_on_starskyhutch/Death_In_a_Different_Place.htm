After the Torino overheats on their way to work:<BR>
Hutch: [brandishing the Hutchinson Finger]: Look, Starsky, I think it's about time you made a choice between this piece of junk and me!<BR>
Starsky: [positively stricken] Don't make me choose.<BR>
<BR>
It's a bit unfair if you ask me - Hutch's piece of junk goes wrong way more than the Torino, and although Starsky complains about it the whole time he never gives Hutch an ultimatum - and in fact purchases an exact copy of the piece of junk after it gets destroyed in Survival.<BR>
<BR>
I must wax lyrical for a moment in praise of the beauty that is Hutch - in the scene where S+H go to thank Blaine, Hutch smiles three or four times, and it's like an angel has flown down from heaven and manifested itself on screen (well, maybe I'm exaggerating just a little bit, but it’s still lovely to see).<BR>
<BR>
Peter: You see two men together and think "How ugly", right?<BR>
Umm, no.  :o)<BR>
<BR>
The classic pincer movement S+H use when they're chasing Nick is really cool. Hutch follows him in the car while Starsky circles round behind him on foot. Very smooth - and actually a variation of a chase I put in the S+H fic I wrote before watching the episode. It's nice to see my version of police technique corroborated in the show!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's leap over the piano in the bar at the end is brilliant, but obviously his counting skills need a little work if he can't even count to six!<BR>
<BR>
Not a particularly great episode, but it has it’s moments.</P>
