Somehow, it didn't surprise me one bit when S+H didn't get to enjoy their three-day weekend. Their holiday got cancelled in Playboy Island, too - don't they ever get a break?<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's in a bit of a bad mood about it, too, and he takes it out on Hutch. He keeps saying, "This is your neighbourhood", reminding Hutch that it's his fault they're involved. We also get the usual glare and complaint of "Don't walk on my car" after Hutch climbs over the hood of the Torino.<BR>
<BR>
The bad guys in this ep are just on the wrong side of freaky if you ask me...<BR>
<BR>
Danny De Vito is a bit of a surprise! All sorts of interesting people turn up in this show!<BR>
<BR>
I like Starsky having to do the deception bit because all the local criminals know Hutch already. It's interesting having them investigating something on what is exclusively Hutch's turf - it changes the team dynamic somewhat.<BR>
<BR>
S+H interacting with Annie's dog is really funny. Only Starsky would stick his tongue out at a Doberman!<BR>
<BR>
The scene where they go in and out of the doors to Dobey's office and then play musical cups with the water is very well choreographed.<BR>
<BR>
The tag's pretty cute, too, and I'm starting to like the longer hair on Hutch - but the whole thing is just a little bit too weird for me to really like this episode.<BR>
