</B><P><BR>
The easy banter at the airport is cute, and I love the way Hutch points out Starsky's watch when he asks what time it is.<BR>
<BR>
We get to see another family who seem close to S+H - Jake's wife is quite comfortable leaning on Hutch while they wait at the hospital. His silent support is lovely.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's stunned incredulity at the news of Jake's death is sweet, too. They make a good team - Hutch looks after Jake's wife while Starsky stays to ask all the important questions. It shows how well they work together - there's no overt assigning of roles, they just do what has to be done.<BR>
<BR>
The search for all the people Jake was in contact with is a little long-winded. In fact, after the bit at the hospital, the rest of part one is all rather tedious. Hutch's leap through the window of the moving Torino is pretty cool, though.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously, the news of Hutch's infection ups the tension about 3000% - nothing like a little deadly virus contracted by one of the heroes to get the excitement levels back up to par!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's expression when Hutch hands him his gun is wonderful - it's as if that action finally brings it home to him that Hutch isn't going to be working on the case any more because he's dying. Then we get one of their classic long exchanges of glances before Hutch is wheeled off to isolation - always a good moment.<BR>
<BR>
Where before S+H were both poodling about in the Torino, tracking down potential carriers in a leisurely fashion and making small talk with the lady doctor, suddenly now Starsky is sprinting out of Dobey's office and screeching round corners on mountain roads. Nothing like a little motivation to get things interesting again.<BR>
<BR>
"Good partners are hard to come by." Starsky could give Henry V a run for his money with his speech to the uniform cops - "once more unto the fields, dear officers, once more..." Good, rousing stuff!<BR>
<BR>
The recap voiceover at the start of part two is brilliantly over the top: "As Starsky and Hutch race against time to bring Calendar back alive, Starsky is soon left alone to fight a more personal battle. The plague that threatens an entire city has claimed Hutch as its latest victim." I'm confused as to why they include scenes in the recap that haven't actually happened yet, though! It got me worried that I'd somehow missed a bit!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's forced cheerfulness is really cute, but I could do without the sickeningly sappy scene between him and Judith through the glass - sappy scenes are supposed to be Starsky's job!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: "I'll empty out my bank account, I'll hock my Torino..." </P>
<P>Awwwwww!! I love Starsky when he's worried about Hutch, and it works the other way round, too.<BR>
<BR>
Just before Starsky asks for the lipstick, Judith gives him a long hard look and you can see her come to the realistion that she'll never get to be as close to Hutch as Starsky is, even if he does survive. The lipstick thing is really cute, too.<BR>
<BR>
And yet again, when one of them is in mortal danger and practically the whole precinct is supposedly on the case, at the pivotal moment, the other one is completely without back-up. S+H really don't like to work with anyone but each other, do they?<BR>
<BR>
The whole of the scene between S+H in the isolation booth is really wonderful - one of the best I've seen so far. </P>
<P>Hutch: "You never were a very good liar..."<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's at his impassioned best in the next scene with Meredith, too: "Hey, my partner's dying! How much more of a last resort do you need???"<BR>
<BR>
After the mad rushing around, yelling and door slamming, Starsky moves into his deadly still phase when he goes to see Roper. This is how we know he's reaching the end of the line - when he goes still, no-one is safe!<BR>
<BR>
Calendar's deal with the cab driver is really cool - $100 if he does as he's told, death if he doesn't - he's got a pretty warped morality, but I guess that's to be expected from a hitman with a heart!<BR>
<BR>
I love the shot of the Torino at the airport at the start of the tag - carefully parked correctly in the lot!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: "Come on, you big blond beauty - I'm gonna take you home and tuck you in." 'Nuff said!!<BR>
<BR>
The second half of this two-parter more than makes up for the leisurely pace of the first half. Worth waiting for.<BR>
<BR>
