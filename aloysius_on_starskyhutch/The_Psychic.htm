<B>The Psychic</P>
</B><P> <BR>
I was thoroughly confused by the opening chase sequence, which I've seen before on the front of a different episode - the Omaha Tiger, I think. What gives? Did they not have enough time to film a different scene or something? Starsky's line about Hutch looking good in basic black and pearls is still funny, though.<BR>
<BR>
The schoolgirl is so sickeningly chirpy, I found myself hoping something awful was going to happen to her - and my wish came true! (I'm not totally heartless - it's just that I used to be a teacher, so now I automatically wish evil on anyone in a school uniform. Besides, she gets a lovely Hutch hug at the end, so you can't feel too sorry for her!)<BR>
<BR>
The scene where S+H eat breakfast in the Torino is great - they are *such* an old married couple! And Starsky's right to complain about Hutch calling him hostile - usually he has to spend most of the episode fending off barbed comments from his supposedly 'mature' partner!<BR>
<BR>
Role reversal continues when they meet the psychic - after The Vampire, it seems strange for Hutch to be the one to buy into the psychic thing, while Starsky dismisses it immediately as fake.<BR>
<BR>
I love the mirrored body language when they're interviewing the carwash owner - another demonstration of just how close S+H are.<BR>
<BR>
"Captain Dobey says that you're the best he has" - what a great line!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is very good with the distraught father - he's so calm and reassuring, which is somewhat of a change from how he is when it's Starsky who's in danger!<BR>
<BR>
Brief aside: Stargate has what I call The Daniel Effect - he looks at people with his big blue eyes and they just fall over themselves to make him happy - or *I* would, at least! Hutch has exactly the same thing going on - who could possibly resist those eyes when he shows the psychic the picture and says, "Would you help us find this girl?" Obviously, the psychic guy is immune, but I'm certainly not...<BR>
<BR>
They certainly go all out when they're apprehending someone, don't they? The poor little sweethearts seem to spend an awful lot of time totally out of breath! Hutch doesn't fare particularly well while trying to stop the robber at the bar - he manages to spend the entire scene on the floor! It's tough being a cop, dontcha think? He gets his pants all dirty too, which I'm sure he wouldn't like.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky, hand in hair: "Sure, we're gonna put out an APB on a six-foot male rose that's on fire. Will you come on, please?" LOL! Poor Starsky looks like he's getting a headache trying to figure out the psychic's clues!<BR>
<BR>
I was just beginning to wonder why people had told me that this is a great episode, when the kidnappers started describing the pay phone plan. I had read a brilliant fic a few weeks before that made reference to Hutch doing this run, and I'd been waiting for the episode to air ever since, but I didn't know which one it was! Suddenly, the excitement was back - and now I understand!<BR>
<BR>
They toss up to see who does the run - but do they get the job of running by winning or losing? Starsky's face suggests he loses the toss, but it's Hutch who does the running - so I guess they both actually want to do it, though a more likely explanation is that they both *don't* want the *other* one to do it. The fact that they know which way round the toss works without discussing it beforehand is pretty cool, too.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky looks really good on the motorbike, but his smooth entrance is somewhat ruined when he can't find the prop without looking!<BR>
<BR>
The banter just before they split up is classic S+H, followed of course by the even more classic long, lingering look (my favourite thing ever!), and also Hutch's habitual touching of Starsky's arm. So much wonderful stuff in the space of about ten seconds.<BR>
<BR>
The tension throughout Hutch's run is just brilliant, and Starsky following him on the bike is really cool. The fight in the alley and the dismissal of the police officers outside the bar is pure primal Hutch at his best, and Starsky going after the bad guys and then racing back to Hutch is even better - wow, what a sequence! And Hutch touching Starsky's hair is a really cute moment.<BR>
<BR>
The tag is cute, too - although Huggy looks even more ridiculous than usual in his chef's hat. What made the whole thing funnier, though, is what happened right at the end. Starsky said, "I'm pickles, he's onions," the credits rolled, and the Channel Five presenter (always good for a laugh) said, "And there's another case for Pickles and Onions at the same time tomorrow!" (I love Channel Five!)<BR>
<BR>
So, an all-round pretty good episode! It doesn’t get into my top favourites list, though. The whole of the payphones chase is wonderful, I'll grant you that - but they're the wrong way round. It's got to be *Starsky* who gets shot and *Hutch* who thinks he's dead - it's just not the same when they switch roles! (Sue me - I'm weird - I freely admit it!)<BR>
