</B><P>What the hell is Starsky wearing when he comes to collect Hutch from the park? That jacket, those shorts, and those socks do not a good outfit make, despite the Starsky fur that's also on show. And Hutch's yellow trousers aren't much better. These are the clothes they wear to go on *dates*?? Oh dear!<BR>
<BR>
When Hutch doesn't like someone, he really isn't afraid to let them know it, is he? I guess when you've got a best friend like Starsky, you don't need any others - but it's a good job they're both skilled at avoiding attempts on their lives, since they seem to spend most of their time antagonising bad guys into trying to kill them!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky seems really disappointed when Hutch says no to dinner - and he's very cute when he's sulking.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch has moved house, I see. I love the way he says hello to his plants when he gets home.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's knowledge of trivia is seemingly bottomless. I would have thought Hutch would have given up being surprised at the stuff he comes out with by now! The look Hutch gives Starsky when he starts reminiscing about old baseball games with Eckworth is lovely, though - there's real affection in his eyes.<BR>
<BR>
It's not a good season for Hutch's girlfriends, is it? But hang on - what's Hutch doing back with Abby anyway? Wasn't he going out with her before Gillian? And why on Earth does he let her make dinner alone in his apartment when he knows the bad guys can get in there?<BR>
<BR>
This isn't really a very jolly episode, is it? It rather depressed me - and not even Starsky adding a ridiculous hat to his shorts and stripy socks combo really helps Wah!<BR>
<BR>
