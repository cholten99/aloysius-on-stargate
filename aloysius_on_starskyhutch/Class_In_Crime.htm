S+H are doing their walking in step thing again as they go down the corridor in the apartment building - very cool, and they look so good from behind.<BR>
<BR>
 Somebody paranoid enough to have a gun at his side while watching TV would *never* sit with his back to the door.<BR>
<BR>
The direction in this episode is all a bit arty for me - too many weird camera angles and too much jangly music. The peripheral characters are a bit weird, too. S+H don't really fit in with the style of this ep, if you ask me.<BR>
<BR>
Trapping Hutch in the door is a bit harsh on Starsky's part, but Hutch's total lack of surprise at finding the woman from the showroom at Starsky's apartment is very characteristic and pretty funny.<BR>
<BR>
S+H spend far too much time apart in this episode - it's fair enough (and actually pretty good) when one of them is in danger and the other one is looking for them, but when they're just going about their own investigations, it's really rather boring.<BR>
<BR>
The whole thing is almost saved by:<BR>
Starsky: How d'you expect to avoid the fate of his other two unfavourite students?<BR>
Hutch: I'm counting on you.<BR>
But not quite.<BR>
<BR>
I also think I've decided I don't like Hutch's longer hair - though (and I really hate to say it) it may yet grow on me...<BR>
