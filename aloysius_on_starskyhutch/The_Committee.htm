Starsky's borrowed the Hutchinson finger for this one, and he uses it freely after Willets gets out on bail. I think it looks better on Hutch, but that could just be me!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is being mean again - taunting Starsky with the description of his burger and then handing the poor guy a tuna burger with extra mushrooms is a bit below the belt! And it sounds to me as if Starsky's sulking bigtime when he tells Hutch to take an aspirin to get his thought to go away - obviously the tuna burger didn't agree with him!<BR>
<BR>
It must be quite hard to stake somewhere out or tail someone in the Torino - it's not exactly inconspicuous, is it?<BR>
<BR>
When Hutch can't even bring himself to meet Starsky's gaze, things can't be good. It was at this point that I started to think something fishy was going on, in a burst of inspiration that is very unlike me. I'm guessing Hutch isn't a good enough actor to pretend to turn against Starsky while looking him in the eye.<BR>
<BR>
I love Starsky's expression after he sends Hutch flying into the policemen's table. You can see him thinking, "I know we set this up, but I think I hit him a bit hard - hope he's okay!" Starsky may be able to act drunk and belligerent, and he may seem completely unapologetic when Hutch complains in the next scene - but those lovely eyes don't lie, and they look worried here.<BR>
<BR>
I seriously hope 'Ginger' doesn't ever have kids, if her 'maternal instincts' prompt a full-on snog...<BR>
<BR>
Dobey's an idiot! I suspected Fargo was involved the minute I laid eyes on him - it makes perfect sense for corrupt cops to have a member of IA on their side, to protect them from investigation and act as a recruiter. It's a damn good thing Hutch is looking out for Starsky, because if it was left up to Dobey, he'd be dead five times over!<BR>
<BR>
Then we get the age-old undercover dilemma - how far do you go to keep your cover intact? Luckily, Starsky doesn't have to decide what to do - or unluckily, considering his cover is blown anyway!<BR>
<BR>
Only someone who really believes what they're doing is right would think they could turn the person sent to catch them. It makes Fargo all the more scary because of his conviction. But then again, it also makes him susceptible to deception, since he's prepared to believe that Starsky can be convinced.<BR>
<BR>
The whole pet rock thing is a bit silly, but I love the way Hutch says, "He lost his rock" as if it's the most logical thing in the world! Dobey's expression is great, too - it's as if he's thinking, "Did he just say what I think he said? Either I'm going mad, or those two are getting weirder by the day!"<BR>
