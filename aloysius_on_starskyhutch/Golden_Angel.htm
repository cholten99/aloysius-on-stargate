A completely unexpected and noiseless gunshot is really weird, and actually fairly anti-climactic. It elicited a definite "huh?" from me, rather than any real intrigue and excitement.<BR>
<BR>
I can't believe that Starsky would consider replacing the Torino, even if he did inherit several million dollars. The banter between S+H over the inheritance is funny, though, and I love the way Hutch stops Starsky from antagonising Dobey "until after they read the will". His affectionate grin as he follows his partner out of the bullpen is really cute, too.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's adorable when he goes to see Stella - I love his light-hearted charming routing.<BR>
<BR>
The humour of this show is rather predictable - but Starsky's re-enactment of the shooting is no less funny for that. Hutch doesn't get much of a better deal talking to Camille - bit weird for me, but Hutch's frustration with her is quite amusing.<BR>
<BR>
Question: What's the Torino doing outside The Pits when Starsky doesn't seem to be there? And where is Starsky anyway?<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's enjoyment of the staged interview of the two wrestlers is really cute - he's such a kid at heart, and Hutch seems just as amused by him as he is by the ridiculous interview.<BR>
<BR>
The whole fight sequence is a bit too silly for me, but the tag is brilliant! Poor Starsky - he does look rather nice in his suit, though, which is strange because he normally looks uncomfortable in formal wear.<BR>
