I do feel sorry for Dobey, having to deal with S+H on a daily basis - especially when they're giving a very confusing report both at the same time. It's vintage telepathy evidence, with both of them knowing exactly what they're talking about and Dobey not having a clue. The way Hutch rubs it in when Dobey requests that he be the one to give the report rather than Starsky is great, too.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky is eating the entire police station again - and actually steals a chocolate bar from the vending machine (and him an upholder of the law, too!) - but for once Hutch doesn't turn his nose up at Starsky's culinary selections:<BR>
Starsky: So where does that leave us, except with us standing here, you eating my lunch?<BR>
<BR>
Cuteness personified later in the same scene:<BR>
Hutch: We've got something Ferguson doesn't have.<BR>
Starsky: Oh yeah? What's that?<BR>
Hutch: Each other.<BR>
All I can say is - awwwwwwwww!<BR>
<BR>
S+H undercover at the clothing store is hilarious - I think Starsky rather suits the black negligee, but the blouse Hutch picks up is hideous!<BR>
<BR>
I wonder if they tossed a coin to decide who got to stand on whose head when listening in on Ferguson, or if Hutch just didn't give Starsky a choice - Starsky always seems to draw the short straw in these situations!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's 'cop on legitimate business' routine when they go to Coyle's office is great - he really throws himself into his roles, doesn't he?<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is wearing his yummy black leather jacket again - it really brings out his eyes. Mmmmmm - oh, sorry - yes, on with the review, got distracted there for a minute...<BR>
<BR>
I just love the chess game at the end. That's the way I play chess, too - be so annoying that the other player is too distracted to be able to play properly. Starsky's definitely got the right idea and he's got irritating Hutch down to a fine art.<BR>
<BR>
I really enjoyed this episode - silliness abounds, but in a good way.<BR>
