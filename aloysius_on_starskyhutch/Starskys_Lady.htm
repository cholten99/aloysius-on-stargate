We discover that, in the little free time they have, our wonderful guys act as basketball coaches for disabled children - is it just me, or is that polishing their halos just a smidge too much? I'm an evil harpy who hates kids, though, so perhaps my opinion doesn't count in this matter! :o)<BR>
<BR>
Blintz alert! And I almost missed it! When Starsky is calling out encouragement to the kids from the sidelines, he says, "Don't let that big blond blintz beat you!" It seems to have become a habit since The Set Up, where Hutch hadn't heard it before. It's interesting that so far he's only used it when *referring* to Hutch, not when speaking to him directly...<BR>
<BR>
This is a difficult admission for a hardened slasher - but I really like Terry, and she and Starsk make a very cute couple. (sob!)<BR>
<BR>
Ack! Influential bad guys with a grudge are never a good thing. It's the patient ones that are always the most dangerous, and you have to give Prudholm credit for his research and meticulous planning. Of course, none of that is any use to him, since the amazing Hutchinson brain smells a rat straight away - but then nobody can really expect to fool him, can they?<BR>
<BR>
I must say Hutch is looking particularly gorgeous in the first half of this episode. I just love his black leather jacket, and concern for Starsky always looks good on him. (He hasn't been mean to Starsky for a couple of episodes, so my favouritism has swung straight back to his beautfiul blondness.)<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so I've got to say it - this storyline is really horrible. Writers who do this kind of thing to our boys shouldn't be allowed anywhere near them! Trapping them under cars at the bottom of cliffs, putting them at the mercy of psychotic cultists, addicting them to heroin, and injecting them with poison - these are all absolutely acceptable turns of events. But lodging bullets in the brains of their girlfriends is just too much!<BR>
<BR>
And where is Hutch when Starsky is given the news that Terry is going to die? Looked like a perfect hug moment to me, but he wasn't even there!<BR>
<BR>
As a policeman, I would have thought Hutch would be more sensible than to keep a key on the ledge above his door!! I know there are several people who might need access to his apartment when he's not there (Huggy, Kiko, Starsky), but surely there's a better way than that.<BR>
<BR>
I like the fact that they just keep on driving straight when the dispatcher tells them to go see Freddy - I mean, the usual immediate u-turn is a lot more dramatic, granted, but the places they're sent to can't *always* be in the opposite direction!<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to refrain from commenting on all the heartrending scenes between Starsky and Terry - just suffice it to say - waaaaaah!!<BR>
<BR>
Wonderful moment of the episode:<BR>
Starsky: You think you're going first?<BR>
Hutch: Right.<BR>
Starsky: Uh-uh. This is mine. Come on...<BR>
Hutch: This is ours, partner. Okay?<BR>
Starsky: Okay.<BR>
Wow. And Awwww. And Yum.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is hilarious when he's drunk, and I just love the fact that he's playing Monopoly on the floor with Starsky in the middle of the night. It's just exactly the kind of thing friends would do in this situation.<BR>
<BR>
The present-opening ritual is wonderful, and I love that Terry gave Starsky the joke present and Hutch the serious one - it's just perfect. I didn't actually cry at the end of this episode, but it was close!<BR>
<BR>
Not an episode I think I'm going to watch a lot, but it's got some lovely moments in it.<BR>
<BR>
