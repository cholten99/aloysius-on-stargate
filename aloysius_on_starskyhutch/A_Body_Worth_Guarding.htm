Starsky's reaction to Hutch waxing philosophical is interesting:<BR>
"It's too early in the morning for that Hutch."<BR>
"You're very werid, you know that?"<BR>
It's actually similar to Hutch's reaction to Starsky playing "What If" in an earlier episode - I don't think they actually disagree with each other half the time, it's just such a habit to make fun of each other that they don't think about it.<BR>
<BR>
As per usual, Starsky looks very uncomfortable in a suit when they go to the theatre, and I think the emphasis on Hutch's superior cultural knowledge is a bit overdone.<BR>
<BR>
Huggy's obviously making money - The Pits now has a neon sign instead of the old board that used to be over the door.<BR>
<BR>
Huggy: You look weird.<BR>
Starsky: What do you mean?<BR>
Huggy: A little lopsided. I know! Cos Starsky without a Hutch is like a pig without the poke.<BR>
The little smile Starsky gives at this is really, really cute.<BR>
<BR>
The way Hutch rolls Anna off the couch and flattens her, and then nearly shoots the bellman is hilarious - not exactly on top of his game, though, is he? The liquorice gun excuse is pretty funny, too.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky identifying himself as Hutch's "better half" is really cool. Regardless of slash, they're way closer to each other than they ever will be to any girl.<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Starsky wanders round the hotel room collecting up Hutch's clothes - it's so obvious he knows what's gone on, and Hutch's failed attempts at being casual are great.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's guitar playing is really lovely - and it's a cute song, too.<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Starsky figures out that Hutch is home by failing to find the key on top of the door - Hutch obviously still hasn't learned about that! However, previously, Hutch has always replaced the key on the doorjamb after using it to open the door, so Starsky's logic is a little faulty. It also means that someone could potentially lock Hutch in his own apartment if they knew about the key!!<BR>
<BR>
My earlier point is proved in the tag - the girl leaves, and Starsky ends the episode falling on top of Hutch - girls may come and go, but nothing is ever going to break up those two!</P></FONT></BODY>
