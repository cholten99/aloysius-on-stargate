Another pair of nicknames is coined for our boys - Spaghetti and Meatballs actually suits them rather well!<BR>
<BR>
Okay, so the guys have discovered something they can't do at last - stunt fighting - and it's funny because you'd think they'd know exactly how to react in a fight - they've been in enough of them!<BR>
<BR>
Jeff Goldblum is the last person I expected to see turning up in this show! It's really weird to see him so young - I checked his birth date on the internet and he's the same age as me in this episode - 25, which is pretty young to be playing a director...<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is ever so cute when he's nervous, and it's such a change from his normal confidence. Starsky's encouragement is rather sweet, too - I might have expected him to be jealous of Hutch getting a line in the movie, but he seems genuinely excited. Hutch's complete ineptitude is hilarious - it's great to see them being bad at something for a change, and the fact that it's acting makes it all the funnier.<BR>
<BR>
I guess there have to be drawbacks to having cool clothes - wearing a short jacket makes it somewhat difficult to use the bottom of it to open a burning door! Starsky's got his old brown jacket on again, though. But ack! He's switched it for the black one by the next day!<BR>
<BR>
Question: What is Starsky doing with Hutch's gun when they confront Wally at the end?<BR>
<BR>
This is a fun ep - though I'm a bit upset that the bad guy killed the dog...<BR>
