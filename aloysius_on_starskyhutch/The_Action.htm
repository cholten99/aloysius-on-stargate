</B><P><BR>
The opening bit with Ted's daughter is adorable (and this coming from someone who hates kids!) - both the guys are wonderful with her.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: Cap'n, you're looking at a couple of aces in a world full of jokers.<BR>
Perhaps a smidge over-confident on the gambling front, but fairly accurate as a general description of them, if you ask me!<BR>
<BR>
S+H pull yet another undercover act out of their repetoire, this time going for nonchalance, which makes a nice change from their more manic personas, but is just as convincing. I love the way Hutch keeps putting his feet up on the bar - it's very cool.<BR>
<BR>
Huggy's confusion over Starsky's fake call is brilliant - "Starsky, did Hutch slam the door on your head again?"<BR>
<BR>
Any episode that includes a steam bath scene is okay in my book - it still amazes me that I can find two so completely different men so darned attractive - but hey, I'm not complaining!!<BR>
<BR>
I do like Hutch's boots, though I'm with Starsky on the sheepskin waistcoat - "You look like you belong to the Himalayan Mounted Police."<BR>
<BR>
I love the competitive edge they introduce with the stupid bets they make with each other, and the way they fight over the money and the chips. It's a nice addition to already well-rounded undercover characters, and it's pretty funny too, fitting in with their usual banter and teasing nicely.<BR>
<BR>
The bad guys' system of having the crap game in a truck is clever - it's always nice when the villains are imaginative, since it makes S+H that much more impressive when they bust them anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Dobey's concern over S+H being unarmed is nice to see - he's just as much a softie as they are, underneath all his bluster.<BR>
<BR>
I always think it's good job bad guys are so lazy - they always give their victims an opportunity to escape by making them dig their own graves.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously, the bad guys used up all their intelligence on the rolling crap game - the prisoners pretending to start a fight with one another is one of the oldest tricks in the book. An oldie, but a goodie!<BR>
<BR>
The ending is cute - I wonder how many families have S+H as adopted 'uncles'. They both fill the role very well. And it's nice that childhood friends of Starsky have taken Hutch into the family, too.<BR>
<BR>
Another fun one - no spectacularly amazing bits, but a good all round entertaining episode.<BR>
