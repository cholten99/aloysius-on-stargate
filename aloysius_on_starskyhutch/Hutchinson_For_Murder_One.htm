</B>
<P>(Written as I watched the episode for the first time – which explains the apparent lack of knowledge of what happens at the end…)</P>
<P><BR>
Hutch's receipt obsession at the beginning is brilliant - I know exactly how he feels! The expenses forms at my office are the bane of everyone's existence.<BR>
<BR>
Lousie looks suspiciously like a guinea pig to me - but whatever makes Starsky happy, I guess! I can see this pet idea leading to disaster, though.<BR>
<BR>
On first appearance, Vanessa really doesn't seem like Hutch's type, which I guess is why they're not still together.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is quite obviously still carrying a torch from the way he looks at Vanessa when she arrives at The Pits, so I'm also guessing the divorce was her idea.<BR>
<BR>
And their subsequent conversation proves exactly that. Now I know why Vanessa is always portrayed as an selfish, manipulative bitch in fanfiction - it's because she's an selfish manipulative bitch! She really does know how to push his buttons, doesn't she? The line about going to the hospital is evil. Poor darling Hutch to have been married to that!<BR>
<BR>
The disparaging comments about Venice Place are a bit uncalled for - Vanessa really does have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, does she?<BR>
<BR>
Ding dong! The witch is dead! :o)<BR>
<BR>
Normally, the girls either die or turn out to be criminals - trust Vanessa to go for the double whammy of both!<BR>
<BR>
I just love the way the shot cuts from a shellshocked Hutch to the Torino screaming round the corner, siren wailing. Starsky's wonderful, leaping over the hood to get to the front door - what a great portrayal of their friendship.<BR>
<BR>
The instant shift from frantic speed to sympathetic care when Starsky arrives in the apartment is great, and the casual but heartfelt caress of Hutch's shoulder is really lovely.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky stays in excellent friend mode, stopping Hutch from attacking Simmonetti and then clocking him one himself - what a great moment!<BR>
<BR>
I love the way Hutch's hair cascades to the floor after he's knocked unconscious - it's gorgeous.<BR>
<BR>
Dobey's line when Simmonetti and Dryden arrive to accuse Hutch of murder is great:<BR>
Dobey: Well, don't be lookin' at Starsky. He ain't goin' anywhere!<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the same scene:<BR>
Starsky: I'll bring him in. I'll bring him in with my resignation.<BR>
Wow - that's even better than "I'll hock my Torino"!<BR>
<BR>
Dobey gets a bit of a rough deal here - he's completely tied, and also adamant in his support of Hutch, but Starsky doesn't give him any appreciation at all. It's understandable, but rather unfair.<BR>
<BR>
I love the shift from Hutch being really hurt that Starsky's come to arrest him to the realisation that Starsky's actually going to help him avoid arrest. The way they work together to trap Dryden without saying a word to each other is brilliant.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's loyalty in this episode is absolute - note the way he says Dobey can come visit "Hutch and I in San Quentin" if their plan doesn't work. He's with Hutch all the way, even if it leads them both to prison.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's eyes are incredibly blue throughout this episode - there are some lovely close-ups of him looking intense or annoyed - yum!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: They want me to bring in Hutch. That's like cutting off my arm. I ain't going for it.<BR>
No need to comment on that line - excellent stuff!<BR>
<BR>
The bad guys are so stupid! You *never* admit to crimes you've committed earlier on - it's bound to get you in trouble! And Huggy popping out of the coffin and yelling "Freeze, sucker!" is hilarious!<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: For a while, I thought I was gonna be out a partner.<BR>
Hutch: It's nice to know I'd be missed.<BR>
Starsky: Are you kidding? It took me months to show you the ropes. I don't wanna go through all that mess again!<BR>
LOL! Affectionate, teasing banter that masks real love - classic S+H.<BR>
<BR>
And I was right! Louise is a guinea pig! I'm rather glad about that - I thought I was going mad at the beginning!!<BR>
<BR>
What a great episode!  Partner solidarity at its best.</P>
