It may be brief, but there's a *wonderful* moment for the slash crowd in the opening of this episode. Hutch comes up behind Starsky, puts his arms around him and hugs him as he's turning him round. They may be playing basketball at the time, but it's really cute!<BR>
<BR>
Yet another adopted family for S+H and, once again, it seems to be Starsky's old friends who have taken Hutch in too.<BR>
<BR>
Personal involvement rears its passionate head once again - always good for angst levels. We also get more physical affection after the news of Jackson's death - Starsky's ruffling of Hutch's hair when they split up is really lovely.<BR>
<BR>
They both get wonderfully emotional scenes in this ep - Hutch trying to stay calm while taking the witness statement is just as emotive as Starsky trying to comfort Mrs Walters and Junior.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky: "When your daddy dies, it's awful hard to see straight." </P>
<P>The voice of experience - there's definitely a story behind that line…<BR>
<BR>
There's a nice pair of close-ups of locked blue gazes when they're outside the pharmacy - they both have such lovely eyes.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, this is a good, angsty episode, with some very nice moments of closeness between S+H.<BR>
