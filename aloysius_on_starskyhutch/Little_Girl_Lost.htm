It's interesting, but it seems my favouritism is steadily shifting. I started off thinking neither of the guys was particularly. About five episodes in, I was starting to think Hutch was occasionally kinda cute. A few eps after that, and I was desperately in love with both of them, but Hutch was still my favourite. Now, though, every time he's mean to Starsky, and Starsky looks upset, my opinion shifts a bit the other way. And the start of this ep gave it a big booster. I *like* the euphoric sentimentality of Christmas, and Starsky's face when Hutch starts railing against it just makes me want to give him a big hug and *lots* of presents!<BR>
<BR>
And speaking of love - every time I see it, I love that car just a little bit more, too. Me? Obsessed? Never! Just ask my parents - they'll back me up and tell you I'm a wonderfully rounded and sane individual - honest! (What's that, mum? Stargate? No, never heard of it...)<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's expression when Hutch takes Molly home with him is great - they are both such incredible softies, aren't they?<BR>
<BR>
How many plants does Hutch have? He seems to have accumulated an entire rainforest since moving to Venice Place. It's nice, though.<BR>
<BR>
The way they watch out for each other is wonderful - and this time it's Starsky's turn to do the watching. He yells for Hutch to get out of the way of the baddies' car, and he stops Hutch from knocking on the Williams' door after they drop Molly off. They don't just protect each other from physical danger, they protect each other from their own bad impulses too, which goes to show how complete their partnership is.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's really cute when he's in Christmas mode. And it's great to see him get the chance to tease Hutch for a change (though he doesn't escape totally unscathed - the dirty look he gives Hutch when he asks if he's ever considered police work as a career is classic!). However, maybe he shouldn't have gone on about the euphoric sentimentality thing quite so much, since Hutch of course gets the last laugh with the Christmas present of the donated tree!<BR>
<BR>
This is a really fun episode.<BR>
