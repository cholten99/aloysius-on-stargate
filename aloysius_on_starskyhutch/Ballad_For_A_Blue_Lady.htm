In my opinion, Paul Michael Glaser shouldn't be allowed behind the camera - he gives me a headache with all his weird shots!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch standing up to Fitch is pretty cool, and he's cute with Marianne at the beginning, but S+H are separated again, which rather ruins things.<BR>
<BR>
Then when they do finally get a scene together, they have a fight - what is up with this episode?<BR>
<BR>
They share the screen for about three minutes in total, and they don't get much more screen time on their own. I'm really not interested in the fate of the annoying woman and her stupid brother, so the rest of the episode I could really do without.<BR>
<BR>
S+H even go up the stairs of the apartment building separately - though Starsky's dramatic shooting stance is very, very sexy!<BR>
<BR>
You would have thought that PMG would have written some better S+H scenes - like the tag for instance, which is the episode's only saving grace. Hutch talking to his plants while Starsky reads a story from the paper about people being eaten by wild monkeys is classic S+H - if the whole episode had been more like this last scene, it would have been tons better!<BR>
