<P>I know Emma-Lou doesn’t manage to escape, but it’s good to see that she makes a fair attempt.  She’s wearing sensible boots and actually gets quite a long way.</P>

<P>Watching S+H work the crime scene is really cool – they’re totally in their element, getting info from the other men at the scene, picking up clues and formulating theories.  They’re certainly not just pretty faces in a flashy car – they’ve got brains to go with their good looks.</P>

<P>Hutch’s disgust at the crime is well characterised, as is Starsky’s acknowledgement of it.  The pat on the shoulder he gives Hutch as they leave the scene is commiserating and bolstering – Starsky’s got his practical hat on while it’s Hutch who demonstrates the emotional response.</P>

<P>S+H both listen very well – they give Zack their full attention and let him talk at his own pace, only interjecting with softly-voiced questions to prompt him along the right lines.  They’re very good with people, and show their sympathy for his loss by their body language rather than spouting effusive condolences.</P>

<P>Zack’s very well characterised, too – he doesn’t show his grief in any overt way, but his slight air of confusion and then sudden anger speak volumes as to his state of mind.</P>

<P>The baddies are interesting – it’s always good when they turn out to have a warped moral code.  Chaco is delighted that their murder is in the newspaper but suddenly gets upset when he discovers the girl they killed was the man’s wife.  The other guy is a more two-dimensional baddie – his obvious pleasure in killing is quite chilling, but he’s less interesting from a psychological point of view.</P>

<P>Starsky’s Cinderella analogy is very cute, especially when it prompts Hutch to call him ‘Prince Charming’.  I like the way he describes Bay City as ‘our little kingdom’, too.</P>

<P>Then we get a rare instance of Starsky putting one over on Hutch, who spends the whole scene searching the car for the toe piece only for Starsky to reveal he had it all along.</P>

<P>Their entry into the fence’s lair is beautifully casual – Hutch responds to the muscle’s threat by launching him easily through the door, while Starsky simply pulls his gun on the other one.  They clear the threat in the space of five seconds with only minimal effort – very cool!  The way Hutch rolls his eyes at Starsky is wonderful – he’s totally unimpressed by the confrontation.</P>

<P>I love the way they both wander around, fiddling with Rolly’s stuff – they threaten with subtlety and it’s very effective.</P>

<P>Hutch gets to show off his superior knowledge of geography when he identifies the port – the way he says it as if everybody should know it is a bit mean, but the way he chortles at Starsky’s response and then calls him ‘Hemmingway’ is very cute.</P>

<P>The superiority vibe continues into the next scene where Starsky loses two dimes to a faulty phone while Hutch get the next door one working straight away and even gets his dime back at the end of the call.  I love Starsky’s insistence that he not forget to mention the snow tyre – his enthusiasm for his discovery is positively adorable.</P>

<P>Huggy’s funny in his scene – the stresses of everyday life as an honest proprietor really don’t suit him, and you can see him wondering if the bar business is really worth all the hassle, which is probably why &quot;Huggy Bear’s&quot; doesn’t last that much longer.</P>

<P>Their second visit to Fat Rolly’s is somewhat less impressive than their first, but we are treated to a classic &quot;Huuuuuutch!&quot; from Starsky as he is swung around in mid air by the big guy they’re fighting.  I love the way Hutch gets up, all confused and holding a coffee pot, and Starsky’s trouble with the word ‘Freeze’ is funny – they’re not invincible, it seems, but they’re very, very cute!</P>

<P>Then, on top of getting trounced in the fight, they get yelled at by Dobey – the smooth and casual act is well and truly destroyed, and they both look rather pathetic nursing their wounds.</P>

<P>Starsky’s report is *wonderful*:</P>
<P>&quot;The fiery red Torino fishtails to a halt.  We spill onto the street, ready for action.&quot;</P>
<P>His obvious pride in it is really lovely, too, and you can see he’s hurt by Dobey’s lack of appreciation of it.</P>

<P>I do like the realism that they’re both clearly in a state of discomfort after the fight.  Usually, the heroes of these shows don’t show any after effects from being thrown across a room, but the fact that they do just makes S+H that much more attractive as characters.</P>

<P>Hutch is really beautiful when he’s being earnest.  I just love the way he promises Zack they’ll get his wife’s killers.  I’d believe anything he said if he turned those lovely blue eyes on me.</P>

<P>Hutch returns Starsky’s pat from earlier – this time on the leg – in order to get his attention.  It’s hardly necessary, but demonstrates how naturally tactile they are with each other.</P>

<P>Angel presents a sad picture – that’s one of the really good things about this show – it may be lighthearted and silly a lot of the time, but it’s also hard-hitting in places and never shies away from serious subjects or realistic portrayal of things like drug addiction.</P>

<P>S+H treat Angel just like they would any other source, with respect and compassion – everybody deserves the same manners as far as they’re concerned, unless of course they’re a criminal.</P>

<P>When they reach their next destination, all it takes is a brief gesture from Hutch and Starsky knows exactly what to do – they don’t need to discuss their plan beforehand, they work purely on instinct and mesh perfectly as a team.</P>

<P>Starsky’s questioning of Chaco is brilliant, and we get some wonderful Starsky sarcasm when he finally gets fed up of Chaco’s total silence:</P>
<P>&quot;You know, you’re one of the warmest, most responsive human beings I have ever had the pleasure to meet.&quot;</P>

<P>Hutch’s utter incredulity when Zack says he’s never seen Chaco before is great – that response was totally unexpected and he just doesn’t know what to think, poor baby!  Then we get an answering &quot;Wha-??&quot; from Starsky – one of my favourites of his habits.  They’re both so cute when they’re confused!</P>

<P>The continuing joke of Starsky being unable to use a telephone is really funny.  It’s exactly the sort of thing that would happen to Starsky, and his growing frustration is very entertaining.</P>

<P>Ah, vigilante revenge – always a good way to shake up the plot, and a very believable reaction for Zack as he's been portrayed.</P>

<P>I love it when Starsky attempts to impress a woman with a joke and it totally falls flat.  The nurse is utterly unaffected by him, and the way Hutch pretends to be embarrassed by his partner is pretty funny, too.</P>

<P>There’s a very brief hand grabbing moment when Harris pulls a shotgun on S+H.  It looks as if they’re both trying to pull the other one down behind cover – very sweet.  Then we get more silent communication in the junk yard, and Starsky finishes things off by demonstrating his flair for creative weaponry with the crane.</P>

<P>It’s nice that they’re upset by Zack’s death despite his interference in the case.  They may not agree with what he did, but they can understand it.</P>

<P>Starsky gets the last word for once in the tag:</P>
<P>Hutch: Hey, Starsky – I’m beginning to think that everybody in this town is crazy, except you and me.</P>
<P>Starsky: Funny, I was beginning to have serious doubts about you.</P>

<P>Altogether, a well-balanced episode with a believable plot and some great moments.</P>
