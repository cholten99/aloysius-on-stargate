I thought Starsky dancing with the can in the road was funny, but then Hutch turned up in his hilarious little car, wearing a stupid hat and scarf, and funny reached a whole new level!<BR>
<BR>
Their banter over the cars is brilliant and their antics at the job centre make a nice change from the sombre atmosphere of the previous episode. Starsky's suit is lovely, and he looks rather wonderful in it.<BR>
<BR>
I love the fact that they seem to be planning their new future together, and the way they just can't resist leaping into the fray to apprehend a criminal is brilliant, especially since they have to be creative without their guns.<BR>
<BR>
The porn movie guy is great, and I love S+H's reactions when they finally figure out what the job actually is!<BR>
<BR>
I can't believe Starsky falls for Hutch's trick in The Pits - he really should know better by now.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the cuteness of the pair of them trying to figure out what to do with their time, it's weird seeing S+H just meandering about with nothing to do. They've always been men of action, and giving up their badges seems to leave them somewhat at a loss.<BR>
<BR>
Laura's revelation of her real identity came as a big shock to me, and Starsky's reaction to it is really lovely. He's such a softie - and so cute with it!<BR>
<BR>
The arc of the story is weird, though - it weaves about all over the place, and confuses the hell out of me! It's not long before I've given up any hope of really understanding what's going on, but it doesn't seem to matter - it's still good!<BR>
<BR>
S+H being unofficially back on the job is great - even if they're freelancing, it's good to see them doing what they do best again. I just can't imagine them being anything other than cops.<BR>
<BR>
I like the way they run into trouble because they don't have their badges any more - it's a clever indication of how much their situation has changed, and how much they used to rely on their authority as cops.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky correcting the FBI guy's grammar is brilliant! As someone who used to teach English, anyone who cares about grammar is okay in my book - sad, I know!<BR>
<BR>
Hutch: Dear Diary - the day my friend and I went for a ride on a bus.<BR>
Oh, how the mighty have fallen! The horrors of public transport!!<BR>
<BR>
And then they have to deal with a female police officer who is totally immune to their charms - the whole scene where they report the stolen engine is hilarious.<BR>
<BR>
Another cool instalment in the build up to the finale.</P>
