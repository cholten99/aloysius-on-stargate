I must say, the whole thing is really Hutch's fault - he makes a big mistake insulting the Torino - it's fairly predictable that Starsky will then try and show it off! And his complaints are a bit weird - they drive really fast to catch people all the time, and it's hardly breaking the law for a police car to run a red light when in pursuit of a suspect...<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, once we get to the hospital section, Starsky's really cute when he's trying to get Hutch to remember stuff. And it's actually a really good premise for a clip show - a hell of a lot better than most clip shows I've seen.<BR>
<BR>
Knowing that Hutch is faking it makes the ep more interesting - I love the way he hesitates when the nurse says she's going to give him morphine, then you can see him relax again as he realises that Starsky is on the case and won't let her.<BR>
<BR>
It may be a clip show, but the clips they choose are damn good ones:<BR>
- Hutch's numbers tirade is one of my favourites<BR>
- Starsky's reaction to finding Hutch in The Fix is a wonderful portrayal of his feelings<BR>
- Hutch running from phone to phone is a fantastic sequence<BR>
- the desert buggy chase is very appropriate and also rather fun<BR>
- Starsky pretending to get in a fight with Hutch is a great moment<BR>
- the scene in Gillian's apartment is one of the best ever<BR>
- opening the presents from Terry is a nice counterpoint to the previous clip and also a wonderful scene<BR>
<BR>
I knew from fanfiction that Hutch was faking before I ever saw the episode.  I wonder if I'd have figured it out from Hutch's slipped remark to the nurse about Starsky learning to use his breaks - I'm not very bright, so I'm not sure, but I guess I'll never know!<BR>
<BR>
I like the way Huggy joins in the reminiscing by telling stories of his own. He does fall into the age-old fault with clip shows - he tells a story he didn't witness, though I guess it's believable that S+H would have told him about it afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
The way Starsky refrains from mentioning the incident in Gillian's apartment is lovely - and his expression tells the story of how he feels about it easily enough. I like the way Hutch softens slightly when he asks about it, and both their expressions after the clip is finished are wonderful.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch is actually pretty sweet when he thanks Starsky for being there for him - you can tell he's beginning to think maybe he's gone a bit too far and Starsky doesn't deserve the trick he's playing on him.<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's eyes are positively beautiful in the close-ups leading up to the clip from Starsky's Lady, and Hutch's continued hesitation at the broach of the subject of Terry really shows how much he's having second thoughts about what he's doing.<BR>
<BR>
I do like the way Hutch reveals that he really does remember, and the way Starsky carries on the argument for a bit before he realises. And Starsky's reaction to Hutch's revelation is brilliant!<BR>
<BR>
The stupid nurse I could really do without, but Dobey's revenge is classic - I love it when he gets the last word.<BR>
<BR>
I had heard a lot of bad things about this episode before I watched it, so I was expecting the most horrific episode ever - which probably helped a lot, since the theory of positive pessimism ensures you will never be disappointed by anything.  I actually really enjoyed this episode - Hutch's behaviour wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting, I got a reminder of some of the best bits from Seasons 1-3, and there were a couple of lovely friendship moments in between, as well as some laughs at the end. As clip shows go, it's one of the best I've seen.<BR>
