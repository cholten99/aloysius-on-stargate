<P>The episode opens on a classic shot of the Torino cruising down the road in the sunshine – the epitome of S+H.</P>

<P>I love the idea of Hutch reading out the comics to Starsky as he drives – it’s so cute, especially when Starsky looks over in disbelief that he actually finds them funny.</P>

<P>I know which ‘blond lovely’ Starsky would be ‘relaxing poolside’ with if I had my way…</P>

<P>It’s nice to see Hutch so obviously happy – he keeps looking over at Starsky with an affectionate smile on his face, and he gets close to giggling at a couple of points.  He really is very beautiful when he smiles.</P>

<P>I like the way the two robbers hold the door open for the old couple as they leave the coffee shop to steal their car – it’s a nice ironic touch.</P>

<P>The revelation that Sarah and Henny have dynamite in the trunk of the car is so unexpected – it’s a great plot twist, making the real criminals victims of something much worse than the crimes they perpetrate.</P>

<P>Starsky runs in ever such an ungainly manner!  I do feel sorry for him, though – the contrast between his frantic sprinting and the reveal of Hutch leaning casually on the hood of the Torino is brilliant.</P>

<P>Hutch: You have the right to remain silent.</P>
<P>Milty: I have the right to remain alive, you mean!</P>
<P>I just love the chase with Milty in the back of the car, complaining about Starsky’s driving!  It adds a whole extra dimension of humour and insanity to the car chase that you’d only get with S+H.</P>

<P>The way Hutch says, &quot;Well, we lost ‘em!&quot; is so resignedly condescending I’m surprised Starsky doesn’t whack him.</P>

<P>The whole scene where S+H interview the witnesses at the liquor store is wonderful.  You’ve got Hutch patiently listening to the garrulous witness, Starsky reassuring the son of the shopkeeper, Hutch tweaking at Starsky’s shirt in search of a pencil (he doesn’t explain and Starsky doesn’t really react, which suggests that Hutch reaching inside his shirt is a common thing…!), Starsky’s patently false smile as the witness launches into his wedding anniversary story for a second time, Hutch’s incredibly sincere request for a pencil, Starsky’s contemptuous glance and subsequent embarrassment when he doesn’t have one either, and their exchange of bemused expressions at the end.  Classic stuff!</P>

<P>I love the way Hutch sits down on the arm of the chair Starsky’s occupying at the old people’s home, and the way Starsky shifts slightly to give him room.  They’re just so completely comfortable with each other – their physical closeness is really nice to see.  They both have such earnest expressions as they start to question the old couple, too – they have lovely manners and an obvious respect for old age – such nice young men!</P>

<P>The cuffs conversation is hilarious – Starsky’s absolute incredulity at Hutch’s suggestion that he put cuffs on Sarah and Henny is really cute and Hutch trying to get Starsky to do it in the first place is brilliant – his insistence that ‘it’s regulations’ is so adorably straight-laced.</P>

<P>Starsky: I think – </P>
<P>Dobey: Don’t!</P>
<P>Poor Starsky!  He never gets any credit and Dobey is so quick to dismiss his opinion.  He was probably just going to come in firmly on Hutch’s side of the argument, though, which is probably why Dobey cut him off – he was having enough trouble dealing with just Hutch.</P>

<P>I love Hutch’s wince as he orders Starsky’s hot dog – with mustard, onions, relish, sauerkraut and chile – I’m not surprised the very idea of it makes him feel ill, but it’s a cute demonstration of how different they are.</P>

<P>The basketball gamble plan is executed with their usual ease and telepathy.  They don’t discuss it beforehand, but Hutch smoothly outlines the second half of the bet, following Starsky’s lead perfectly and never even questioning the plan.  They may disagree on hot dogs but they always present an absolutely united front when they’re working.</P>

<P>The basketball game is wonderful – S+H work together beautifully on the court, as you might expect, but they also really seem to enjoy it, so we get lots more cute smiles.</P>

<P>I’m confused, though – Dobey calls them to say that Huggy says they can find information at Jackson High School, but gives them nothing else.  By the time they get there, they know they’re looking for a ‘salt and pepper combo’ who’ve come in from Denver the week before.</P>

<P>We get to see their more aggressive side at the bookies, completing the demonstration of all the aspects of their personalities – it’s very well rounded episode.</P>

<P>Hutch is still in an inordinately good mood as he teases Starsky while they’re watching Sally-Ann Dance, and we’re treated to a full-out laugh.  Their expressions as they then listen to Sally-Ann talk are brilliant – Starsky looks positively mesmerised, like a rabbit caught in headlights, and Hutch just looks amazed that she can spout so much drivel in such a short space of time.  Then we get a classic pat on the leg for Starsky from Hutch as they leave.</P>

<P>They’re being psychic again – Sally-Ann doesn’t tell them where Ted’s body shop is, but somehow they manage to turn up there anyway.</P>

<P>Even despite the frustration fo Wilbur and Greg getting away from them, and in the face of the time pressure they’re under, Hutch is still chortling as he pretends he can’t hear Dobey on the radio, and smiling at Starsky’s continuing complaints about his tyres.</P>

<P>Henny: I have a great deal of confidence in those two young men.  Don’t you think a lot of them, Captain?</P>
<P>Dobey: Yes, Mr Wilson – I think of them a lot.</P>
<P>Even though he twists the words to make what he says almost an insult, you can tell by Dobey’s face he really agrees with Henny – very sweet!</P>

<P>We get a little show of good cop/bad cop when S+H confront Ted, with Hutch aggressively stating that the car is a bomb, while Starsky puts his arm around Ted’s shoulders and coaxes the information out of him.  They have so many different tactics and they always know exactly which ones to use in any given situation.</P>

<P>The scene back at the station is classic – Dobey yells at S+H about submitting their reports, they roll their eyes at each other and ignore him, and then Starsky steals Dobey’s hamburger!  I do feel sorry for Dobey, having to put up with the pair of them.  Half the time, they act like naughty schoolboys around him.</P>

<P>Continuity error – Starsky identifies the car to Henny as a 1963 Chevy, but the radio announcer says 1973.</P>

<P>Hutch looks ever so bereft standing alone in the smoke after Starsky drives the Chevy out of the garage.  He must hate Starsky going off in the car on his own, and they don’t even have time for one of their characteristic lingering glances as they split up.</P>

<P>Starsky’s leap into the bushes is remarkably energetic – they look quite spiky, too!</P>

<P>I like the fact that Hutch gets to do a dangerous solo bit, too, pursuing Wilbur throught the garage.  His roll over a car hood is just as energetic as Starsky’s leap into the bushes.</P>

<P>When Starsky arrives back in the garage to find Wilbur wounded on the ground, he looks totally stunned – so much so that Hutch has to prompt him, &quot;Don’t stand there with your mouth open, cuff him!&quot; – and remains clearly confused for the rest of the scene.  I found this reaction really weird, but a good friend managed to explain it brilliantly, so I now pass you over to Jerrye:</P>

</FONT><P>&quot;Starsky didn't expect everything to be finished, with the bad guys all tied up in that few minutes he'd been saving the city. He also hadn't come down from the rush he'd been on. Seems even the motorcycle cop was a little confused. Also, he'd been within seconds of dying, worried about others going with him. He'd been bounced out on his butt and near an explosion. He'd probably been a little like a drowning man for those, three minutes. So he was all shook up and coming down from a high. Maybe Hutch never ceased to amaze him, also.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">Makes perfect sense to me!</P>

<P>The tag in the old people’s home is really cute.  Hutch looks very smooth in his in his polo neck sweater and suede jacket, but what Starsky is doing wearing a ridiculous bow tie, I don’t know!  At least he takes it off as soon as the Councilman leaves.</P>

<P>Hutch throws another affectionate smile at Starsky as he tells Sarah and Henny they won’t be going to prison, rounding off an excellent episode that has all the right ingredients and a fun plot to boot!</P>
