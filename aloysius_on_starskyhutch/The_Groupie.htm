The strategy session between S+H in the interrogation room is great - they couldn't stand much closer together, could they? And I love it when they formulate a plan to interrogate someone - it's always so clever and so much fun to watch. They make an excellent team. This occasion is no different - the 'ping pong' interrogation is really cool, and very effective. I almost feel sorry for poor Harold - he hasn't even got a whisper of a chance against these two!<BR>
<BR>
Then we get more wonderfully over the top undercover characters - sometimes they're a little too much for me, but these two I really love. Hilarious interaction between Starsky's passionate and expansive photographer and Hutch's nasal and geeky buyer - classic stuff!<BR>
<BR>
I love the handshake bit in Dobey's office - S+H do a firm, macho handshake with each other after each getting an incredibly weak one from Mr Marks. It's very cute and funny. Their derisive attitude towards him throughout the meeting is great, too, and a good contrast with their undercover personas.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's undercover insulting of Huggy is brilliant, as is Huggy's retaliation.<BR>
<BR>
Hutch's stammer comes out sounding like Porky Pig when he's playing Jack Ives - it's very funny!<BR>
<BR>
Poor Huggy - he doesn't get much appreciation from S+H any more, does he? I guess that's one problem with being a snitch who makes friends with the cops to whom he gives information - they start expecting him to help out without being paid.<BR>
<BR>
So Hutch has a scar on his lower back, does he? I don't remember that happening in any of the earlier episodes, so there must be a fic in there somewhere...<BR>
<BR>
Starsky's turkey impression is great - interesting way to get the bad guy to open the door!<BR>
<BR>
The climax of Starsky's peekaboo act and Hutch's Tarzan impression is so ridiculously silly - but in a good way. This whole episode is gloriously insane - one of the silly episodes I actually really like.<BR>
