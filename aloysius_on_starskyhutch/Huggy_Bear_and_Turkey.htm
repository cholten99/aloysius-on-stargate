Watching Starsky, dressed as an old woman, trying to detain a very tall bad guy by leaping on his back and hanging onto some railings, all the while yelling, "Huuuuuutch!!!" nearly made me choke on my pizza right off the bat. In addition to that, S+H make very convincing hairdressers - Starsky in particular seemed to be really getting into it, though I'm not sure quite what state their customers would have left in! Plus, we get Starsky commenting on Hutch's eyes again: "Do you know your eyes flash when you're angry?"<BR>
<BR>
*However*, those two scenes notwithstanding, I feel I really must object to "Starsky &amp; Hutch" not having Starsky and Hutch in it!! I quite liked Huggy's partner (where did he spring from, anyway?) but I think abandoning the spin-off series this was supposed to be a pilot for was an eminently sensible plan.<BR>
<BR>
S+H rolling up in the Torino to save the day elicited an even more resounding cheer from me than normal. I think Hutch executed his characteristic forward roll with extra panache on the rooftop, but it could have just been that I was so glad to actually see him! I guess having to do without something you love only makes you appreciate it more when it comes back - and boy, was I appreciating by the end of this episode!<BR>
