<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We ran, and we kept on running.  Through the forest and out onto the plains we ran.  Over rocks and up hills, along gullies and across streams.  I had never before travelled in such a landscape.  It was so open and sparse; it made me feel very small and vulnerable.  But there was not time to dwell on such things.  My whole world narrowed to the stretch of land in front of my feet, Aragorn ahead of me and Gimli behind.  The Uruk-hai were relentless, forging across the plains with our friends in their clutches.  The image that kept me going was that of Merry and Pippin, scared and alone, in the hands of the enemy, facing who knew what tortures at the end of their enforced journey.  We had lost Gandalf in the deep dark of Moria and I had watched Boromir die on the outskirts of Emyn Muil.  I was not prepared to allow those two young hobbits to suffer a similar fate and I knew my companions felt the same.</P>

<P>Aragorn’s life as a ranger must have involved a great deal of cross-country travelling and tracking, but I had never witnessed his skills and endurance in action before now.  He pressed on tirelessly by day and by night, leading us in sure pursuit of our quarry without hesitation or pause.  I had the light feet and youthful energy of the elves on my side, but it was my pride more than anything that kept me from showing any sign of fatigue.  If Aragorn could force the weaker flesh of a man to this task, I was not going to utter one word of complaint.  That role was reserved for poor Gimli with his shorter legs and heavier armour.  We almost lost him when our path forced us to cross a river without time to seek out a suitable ford.  The current proved stronger and the riverbed deeper than we had expected and it was only Aragorn’s quick reflexes and out combined strength that prevented Gimli from being swept away.  Even after that, he kept up with us valiantly, still managing to find enough breath to comment on the situation at regular intervals, despite his difficulties.</P>

<P>After three days, the morning sun found Aragorn lying flat on the rock, listening to the vibrations sent back through it by the pounding feet of the Uruk-hai.  I had been running a while with Gimli and so was a little way behind, but I heard Aragorn mutter to himself, &quot;Their pace has quickened.  They must have caught our scent.&quot;  He rose back up and immediately set off once more, calling back over his shoulder, &quot;Hurry!&quot;</P>

<P>I mounted the hill, then stopped briefly and looked back for the dwarf, shouting, &quot;Come on, Gimli.&quot;</P>

<P>He did not reply to me directly, instead continuing his running commentary.</P>

<P>&quot;Three days’ and nights’ pursuit… no food… no rest… and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell…&quot;</P>

<P>His breathing was laboured, but I think he took strength from his reiteration of the hardships we were suffering, as if reminding himself of how far we had come allowed him to feel a motivating sense of achievement.  From the glares he kept throwing in my direction, I think he didn’t appreciate me looking back to check on him, but I figured annoying him in this way would help keep him hard on my heels.</P>

<P>Aragorn and I paced each other, taking turns in the lead and urging one another to greater speed as we crossed the plains.  It therefore took me somewhat by surprise when Aragorn suddenly stopped in a gully and bent to pick something out of the mud.  My heart surged with hope when I saw what it was that he held in his hand – a small leaf-shaped brooch identical to the one that held my own elven cloak closed.  Not only did it tell us that we were on the right track, but it also suggested that the hobbits were unharmed.</P>

<P>&quot;Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall,&quot; Aragorn said, echoing my own thoughts.</P>

<P>&quot;They may yet be alive,&quot; I agreed.</P>

<P>He continued his assessment.  &quot;Less than a day ahead of us.  Come!&quot;</P>

<P>A clattering behind me heralded Gimli toppling down the hill.  I glanced back to see him literally roll to his feet and continue grimly on.</P>

<P>&quot;Come, Gimli,&quot; I shouted in encouragement.  &quot;We are gaining on them!&quot;</P>

<P>His reply made me smile.  &quot;I’m wasted on cross-country,&quot; he announced.  &quot;We dwarves are natural sprinters.  Very dangerous over short distances.&quot;  I was not sure if he was deliberately making a joke, but it certainly amused me.</P>

<P>We came up out of the gully onto a rise of land that afforded a view right across the plains before us.  I caught up to Aragorn, who had stopped again.</P>

<P>&quot;Rohan,&quot; he told me.  &quot;Home of the horse lords.&quot;  Then he turned his thoughts to the Uruk-hai, as I jumped ahead onto the rocks to find a better vantagepoint.  &quot;There’s something strange at work here.  Some evil gives speed to these creatures.  Sets its will against us.  Legolas!&quot; he called to me.  &quot;What do your elf eyes see?&quot;</P>

<P>I tracked the progress of the black dots that were our quarry and noticed that their course had changed.  &quot;The Uruks turn Northeast,&quot; I shouted back to Aragorn, then realised where their destination lay.  &quot;They are taking the hobbits to Isengard.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Saruman,&quot; Aragorn murmured, giving a name to our fear.</P>

<P>Saruman had hindered our journey from the beginning, sending the Crebain to mark our position, bringing down the mountain of Caradhras upon us and despatching the Uruk-hai to ambush us as we left the river.  Now it seemed he hoped to gain the Ring for himself by capturing the hobbits.  Little did he know that his minions had snatched the wrong ones, and I did not like to think how he might vent his anger should he discover their mistake.  It was imperative that we rescue Merry and Pippin before they were brought to Isengard, but the unnatural speed of the Uruk-hai made me despair that we would ever catch them.</P>

<P>I watched their progress with amazement as I led the way down the hill.  &quot;They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them,&quot; I commented.</P>

<P>I could only hope that their relentless passage meant they had no time to make sport with their poor young captives along the way.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>We ran through another night and, as the sun rose on the fourth day of our pursuit, a strange feeling of dread crept over me.  I glanced back at the sunrise and the colour of the sun confirmed my apprehension.</P>

<P>&quot;A red sun rises,&quot; I said.  &quot;Blood has been spilled this night.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn was checking the ground for tracks when a whistle pierced the air.  He beckoned for us to follow him and we quickly hid behind some rocks as the sound of approaching horses reached our ears.  A large group of riders came into view and galloped past us, banners waving in the morning breeze.  Aragorn caught my eye and silently conveyed his intention to reveal our position.  I nodded my agreement warily, trusting his judgement, and followed with Gimli as he stood up and walked back down to the flat ground.</P>

<P>&quot;Riders of Rohan!&quot; Aragorn called out.  &quot;What news from the Mark?&quot;</P>

<P>The horsemen immediately wheeled round and galloped back to where we stood, but they did not stop at a friendly distance, instead circling around us, tightening their ring until they had us completely surrounded.  Aragorn glanced his chagrin at this unexpected turn of events, but there was no time for words.  The riders brought their spears downwards and suddenly we had weapons in our faces.</P>

<P>Their leader, an impressive figure in plumed helmet and ornamented armour, spoke.  &quot;What business does an elf, a man and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?  Speak quickly!&quot;</P>

<P>It was Gimli who replied, his exasperation at the situation no doubt prompting his words, though I noted he kept his tone neutral.  &quot;Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.&quot;</P>

<P>The man dismounted from his horse smoothly and stepped forwards to glare down at Gimli.  &quot;I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.&quot;</P>

<P>I had had enough by this point.  This was one time too many that my friends had been threatened in recent times, and these men were supposed to be on our side.  I brought my bow up swiftly and aimed it directly at his face.</P>

<P>&quot;You would die before your stroke fell,&quot; I warned him with all the menace I could muster.</P>

<P>The riders edged closer at this threat to their leader and the situation could have turned nasty had Aragorn not stepped in to diffuse it.  He laid his hand on my arm and pushed my bow back down before turning to the Rohan warrior.</P>

<P>&quot;I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn,&quot; he said calmly.  &quot;This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland realm.  We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.&quot;</P>

<P>The warrior spoke worrying words in reply, his tone bitter.  &quot;Theoden no longer recognises friend from foe.&quot;  Then he removed his helmet, revealing blond hair and chiselled features, his eyes full of pain.  &quot;Not even his own kin.&quot;  He nodded at his men, and the spears were withdrawn.  &quot;Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.  My company are those loyal to Rohan.  And for that, we are banished.&quot;  I was shocked at his words, not realising how far Saruman’s evil had reached.  &quot;The White Wizard is cunning.  He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked.  And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.&quot;  This last was spoken with a suspicious look at the three of us, and I then understood his reaction to our appearance.</P>

<P>&quot;We are no spies,&quot; Aragorn said firmly.  &quot;We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.  They have taken two of our friends captive.&quot;</P>

<P>Hope and dread surged in equal measure at the warrior’s next words.  &quot;The Uruks are destroyed.  We slaughtered them during the night.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli asked the question that was foremost in all our minds, his tone urgent.  &quot;But there were two hobbits, did you see two hobbits with them?&quot;</P>

<P>The man looked confused, so Aragorn clarified.  &quot;They would be small, only children to your eyes.&quot;</P>

<P>Our new acquaintance killed all our hopes in one fell swoop.  &quot;We left none alive.  We piled the carcasses and burned them.&quot;  He gestured off into the distance and, following the line of his arm, my eyes alighted on smoke coming up over the hill.</P>

<P>&quot;Dead?&quot; Gimli asked, disbelievingly.  I did not want to believe it myself, but the warrior seemed sure.</P>

<P>He nodded.  &quot;I am sorry.&quot;</P>

<P>I looked down at Gimli, throwing my arm across his shoulders in a gesture of mutual comfort, but nothing could dispel the cold void that had settled over my heart.</P>

<P>The Rohan leader whistled then and called, &quot;Hasufel!  Arod!&quot;  Two riderless horses appeared from within the throng and stopped beside him.  &quot;May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.  Farewell.&quot;  He replaced his helmet and then remounted his own horse.  &quot;Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope.  It has forsaken these lands.&quot;  That ended our bleak discourse.  He addressed himself next to his men.  &quot;We ride north!&quot;</P>

<P>The riders all turned to follow him and soon they were but a distant cloud of dust on the horizon, while we three stood stunned where they had left us.</P>

<P>&quot;Come,&quot; Aragorn said eventually.  &quot;I will not believe they are dead until I see their bodies for myself.  We have not come this far just to give up on them now.&quot;</P>

<P>With that, he smoothly mounted the chestnut horse.  I took charge of the grey, Arod, pulling Gimli awkwardly up behind me, and we set off in the direction of the smoke.  It was not long before we came upon a stinking pile of carcasses, marked by the decapitated head of an Uruk-hai, mounted upon a spear at the edge.  We left the horses at a little distance and made our way forwards.  The smell was almost overpowering but our desperate need for some sign of the hobbits’ survival pushed us on.  Gimli began sifting through the smouldering pile and soon held up a charred piece of leather with a dagger sheath of elven design attached to it.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s one of their wee belts,&quot; he announced sadly.</P>

<P>It now seemed sure that our friends were lost to us.  I closed my eyes against the sight of their funeral pyre and murmured a prayer for their souls.</P>

<P>Aragorn kicked an orc helmet away from the pile, then let out an anguished yell, falling to his knees with his fists raised in frustration.  I wanted to rail and scream with him, but my body was frozen in shock and grief, unable to comprehend that two such bright and vibrant flames should have been extinguished.</P>

<P>&quot;We failed them,&quot; Gimli muttered.</P>

<P>Movement from Aragorn caught my attention and I watched as he shifted to one side, tracing his hand over the grass.  &quot;A hobbit lay here,&quot; he said, his voice sorrowful.  &quot;And the other.&quot;  Then his tone lifted as he followed the signs of their progress across the battlefield.  &quot;They crawled,&quot; he told us, echoing their movement.  &quot;Their hands were bound.&quot;  I followed him through the grass, wondering where his tracking would lead us.  He reached out suddenly and brought up some severed rope from where it had been hidden.  &quot;Their bonds were cut,&quot; he announced, his words becoming more hopeful, though I dared not join him in that yet.  He moved forwards, continuing the tale of what he found.  &quot;They ran over here.  They were followed.  The tracks lead away from the battle.&quot;  He started to jog in the direction they led but was brought up short by the treeline.  I came up beside him, my sprits lifting now that the survival of the hobbits seemed possible, but my heart froze again at his final words, &quot;…into Fangorn Forest.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Fangorn!&quot; Gimli exclaimed in horror.  &quot;What madness drove them in there?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Necessity.  Pursuit.  The lesser of two evils perhaps,&quot; Aragorn surmised.  &quot;But where they have gone, we will follow.  We cannot give up, not now that hope has been renewed.&quot;</P>

<P>He led us into the trees.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Our fear for the hobbits in Fangorn was not superstition or fancy.  I felt the tremendous life force of the forest as soon as we stepped beneath the leaf canopy and, even though I knew there would be no threat to me from the trees, I was well aware of the danger they could pose toward others.  I could sense a great power emanating from the wood, at once awful and wonderful.  Fangorn slept, its mind lost in deep dreaming, but that only increased the risk that its body might lash out against anyone who disturbed its slumber.  It felt familiar to me, and yet alien too, the underlying emotions dark and chaotic, prompting a surge of homesickness in me for the peace of the Mirkwood.</P>

<P>Gimli stomped through the underbrush in front of me, his heavy movement and cumbersome apparel standing out even more than usual in our current surroundings.  The forest seemed bent on hindering his progress, and his curses pierced the heavy silence with jarring frequency.  Then he stopped suddenly, and I nearly collided with him.  He reached out and touched something dark that was smeared on a nearby leaf, bringing it up to his lips.</P>

<P>&quot;Orc blood!&quot; he spat, moving forwards more cautiously, but there was no sign of the orc it had come from or the hobbits the orc had presumably been chasing.</P>

<P>Aragorn found sign of something else, however, stopping to examine some marks in the ground.  &quot;These are strange tracks,&quot; he said worriedly, and I wondered what manner of creature could baffle him so.  I could tell the atmosphere of the forest had him on edge, and even Gimli was affected by it, though the dwarf’s attempt to express his discomfort was characteristically practical.</P>

<P>&quot;The air is so close in here,&quot; he complained, as if the humidity was at fault.</P>

<P>Aragorn had been raised by elves and was almost as at home in the woods as I, so I knew he needed no explanation of their power, but I wanted Gimli to understand so I tried to put it into words.</P>

<P>&quot;This forest is old,&quot; I said, my vocabulary failing me before the enormity of what I was trying to describe.  &quot;Very old.  Full of memory… and anger.&quot;</P>

<P>A deep rumbling noise became audible, off in the distance, as if some huge creature was muttering to itself in its sleep.  &quot;The trees are speaking to each other,&quot; I told my companions.</P>

<P>&quot;Gimli!&quot; Aragorn said sharply, and I turned to see the dwarf brandishing his axe in evident alarm.  He uttered a confused grunt at the sound of his name, and Aragorn elaborated by making a calming gesture and instructing, &quot;Lower your axe.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They have feelings, my friend,&quot; I said.  &quot;The elves began it, waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.&quot;</P>

<P>But the wonders of nature were lost on Gimli and he took refuge in flippancy, dismissing his own apprehension with a snort.  &quot;Talking trees,&quot; he muttered.  &quot;What do trees have to talk about?  Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.&quot;</P>

<P>At that moment, a sudden flash of heightened awareness took my attention away from Gimli, and I lapsed into elvish as my instincts took over.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Aragorn, something is out there,</I>&quot; I warned, scanning the trees for some physical sign.</P>

<P>He immediately went on alert, demanding, &quot;<I>What do you see?</I>&quot;</P>

<P>It was not what I saw, however, but what I felt – a very different kind of presence, power that walked on two legs and commanded a blinding light.</P>

<P>&quot;The White Wizard approaches,&quot; I said, not sure where the words came from or even what they might portend.</P>

<P>Aragorn accepted my intuition without hesitation, instructing softly, &quot;Do not let him speak.  He will put a spell on us.  We must be quick.&quot;</P>

<P>There was a moment’s pause while we prepared ourselves and then we swung round together, Aragorn wielding his sword while I let loose an arrow.  A white figure had indeed appeared behind us, but our attack proved entirely fruitless.  Gimli’s thrown axe exploded into shards of metal, reminding me ominously of when he had tried to destroy the Ring in Elrond’s council chamber.  My arrow was effortlessly deflected and Aragorn’s sword grew red with a sudden heat that forced him to drop it.  We were at once powerless before an unknown adversary, who was shielded by a bright white light that dazzled our eyes.  A strange, layered voice emanated from the figure, stating his knowledge of our purpose there.</P>

<P>&quot;You track the footsteps of two young hobbits.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Where are they?&quot; Aragorn demanded with more confidence than I felt at that moment.</P>

<P>&quot;They passed this way the day before yesterday,&quot; the voice continued, and there was something familiar about the tone, though I could not identify it.  &quot;They met someone they did not expect.  Does that comfort you?&quot;</P>

<P>It did not.  How could we trust this hidden figure’s word that Merry and Pippin were still alive, and what did he mean about them meeting someone unexpected?  I had neither seen nor heard any evidence of their safety that would satisfy me.</P>

<P>&quot;Who are you?&quot;  Aragorn changed the focus of his questioning.  &quot;Show yourself!&quot;</P>

<P>The light dimmed, the figure stepped forward and my heart soared as I saw it was Gandalf who stood before us.  A radiant, powerful Gandalf, dressed in white robes and carrying a pure white staff.</P>

<P>Aragorn voiced our mutual amazement.  &quot;It cannot be!&quot;</P>

<P>My own feelings were ones of guilt at our hasty attack, and relief that it had proved unsuccessful.  &quot;Forgive me,&quot; I said, going down on one knee.  &quot;I mistook you for Saruman.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I am Saruman,&quot; he said, his reply enigmatic but his tone warm, &quot;or rather, Saruman as he should have been.&quot;  My mind was still too overwhelmed by his appearance to puzzle out his meaning.</P>

<P>Aragorn was evidently still in shock as well, murmuring disbelievingly, &quot;You fell.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Through fire and water,&quot; Gandalf confirmed.  &quot;From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.&quot;  He wove a spell with his words and images of this titanic battle were conjured in my mind as he spoke.  &quot;Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.&quot;  Sensations accompanied the images and I felt triumph, followed closely by great weariness and pain.  &quot;Darkness took me.  And I strayed out of thought and time.  Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the earth.&quot;  Wonder and overwhelming peace filled me, suddenly replaced by an unexpected jolt and a renewed sense of urgency as Gandalf continued, &quot;But it was not the end.  I felt life in me again.  I’ve been sent back until my task is done.&quot;</P>

<P>His speech ended and I was released from the vision it created, but the enormity of what he had experienced left me reeling.</P>

<P>Aragorn broke the breathless tension by stepping forwards and saying simply, &quot;Gandalf,&quot; his voice filled with warmth and joy.</P>

<P>The wizard looked confused for a moment.  &quot;Gandalf?&quot; he queried, then he smiled.  &quot;Yes.  That was what they used to call me.  Gandalf the Grey.  That was my name.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gandalf!&quot; Gimli exclaimed, overjoyed, speaking for the first time since the wizard’s appearance.</P>

<P>&quot;I am Gandalf the White,&quot; came the reply.  He said it as if he was actually a completely separate person from our old friend and guide and, from what my vision had shown me, I wondered if that might not essentially be so.  He continued, his tone suddenly more serious, &quot;And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.&quot;</P>

<P>He started to move off through the trees and we all followed, listening intently to what he had to say.  &quot;One stage of your journey is over, another begins.  We must travel to Edoras with all speed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Edoras?&quot; Gimli questioned.  &quot;That is no short distance.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn reported the news we had gained from the Rohirrim.  &quot;We hear of trouble in Rohan.  It goes ill with the king.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Gandalf confirmed, &quot;and it will not be easily cured.&quot;</P>

<P>I wondered how far his knowledge stretched, but Gimli was focused on more practical concerns.</P>

<P>&quot;Then we have run all this way for nothing,&quot; he grumbled.  &quot;Are we to leave those poor hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested…&quot;  He trailed off as the deep rumbling of the trees suggested they disapproved of his tone.  &quot;I mean charming, quite charming forest,&quot; he rectified hastily, and I couldn’t help but smile at his nervousness of the wood.</P>

<P>Gandalf turned back to address Gimli.  &quot;It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.  A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.  The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn said, &quot;In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.  You still speak in riddles.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandalf chuckled and looked round at the trees as if in anticipation.  &quot;A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days,&quot; he told us.  &quot;The Ents are going to wake up… and find that they are strong.&quot;</P>

<P>I thought back on the effect Merry and Pippin had had on me in the earliest stages of our journey and my spirits lifted as I imagined how their exuberance would impact on the slow, deliberate shepherds of the forest.</P>

<P>&quot;Strong?&quot; Gimli exclaimed in confused uncertainty.  He looked up at the trees nervously.  &quot;Oh, that’s good.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf,&quot; Gandalf concluded.  &quot;Merry and Pippin are quite safe.  In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.&quot;</P>

<P>He moved on through the forest, Aragorn at his side.</P>

<P>Gimli lingered for a moment, muttering to me, &quot;This new Gandalf’s more grumpy than the old one.&quot;</P>

<P>I smiled.  &quot;He can be as grumpy as he likes,&quot; I replied, &quot;just as long as he’s here.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli grunted agreement and we followed the others out of Fangorn and back onto the plains of Rohan.  Hasufel and Arod were waiting patiently exactly where we had left them.  I was just beginning to wonder if they would be able to bear all four of us, when Gandalf uttered two haunting whistles and a horse suddenly materialised in the distance as if from thin air.  It was a magnificent beast, pure white and perfectly formed, and it cantered to a halt before Gandalf.  Its beauty and grace nearly took my breath away.</P>

<P>&quot;That is one of the Mearas,&quot; I murmured, &quot;unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Shadowfax,&quot; Gandalf said, and the horse whickered and nodded, moving forwards into the wizard’s embrace.  &quot;He is the lord of all horses, and has been my friend though many dangers.&quot;</P>

<P>We all mounted our horses, Gimli taking his place behind me on Arod.  Then we set out for Edoras, our purpose once again shifting as events overtook us.  I had no idea what we were now riding towards, and could only trust that Gandalf’s judgement was correct, an act of faith I had no difficulty in making.  To Edoras Gandalf said we must go, so to Edoras we turned our steps.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Travelling on horseback was obviously much faster than by foot, though probably just as uncomfortable for poor Gimli.  He had not the natural balance of a horseman, moving against the motion of the animal instead of in tandem with it.  And embarrassment he might have felt about being so close to me was quickly abandoned in favour of staying on the horse.  He clamped his arms tightly round my waist, forcing me to protest.</P>

<P>&quot;A little looser, if you please, Gimli,&quot; I called over my shoulder.  &quot;If I lose consciousness from lack of breath, we shall both fall off!&quot;</P>

<P>He grumbled something about ‘the flippancy of elves’, but relaxed his grip slightly.</P>

<P>Shadowfax flowed over the plains, seemingly a part of the land rather than a being moving on top of it.  Hasufel and Arod kept up with him valiantly, tireless and determined.  The same could not be said for my companion, however.  As the day began to wane and the shadows stretched across the grass before us, Gimli tugged on my tunic and growled in my ear, &quot;Halt this damn beast!&quot;</P>

<P>I pulled Arod up immediately, fearing some problem and, as soon as the horse had stopped, Gimli released his hold on me and tumbled off onto the ground.  Aragorn, who had been riding behind us, came up alongside and called out, &quot;What is the matter?&quot;</P>

<P>Up ahead, Gandalf looked back over his shoulder to find us no longer following him.  Without any apparent guidance from the wizard, Shadowfax wheeled around and cantered back to our position.</P>

<P>&quot;Why have you stopped?&quot; he asked, echoing Aragorn’s concern with a certain amount of impatience.</P>

<P>&quot;Enough!&quot; Gimli declared from the ground.  &quot;The three of us have been travelling for four days straight, with no rest and no sustenance.  The rest of you may be able to survive on air alone, but I cannot and I am not afraid to admit it.  Edoras will still be there in the morning.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn looked at me, but I merely shrugged, unwilling to enter into an argument with a stubborn dwarf when I myself was also weary.</P>

<P>Gandalf sighed.  &quot;I suppose a short rest would not do any harm.  Besides, it would be unfair to ask your steeds to continue on after dark.&quot;  He looked all around from his vantagepoint atop Shadowfax.  &quot;The outcropping of rock over there will provide some shelter, and the copse of trees may provide some dinner.  If our Master Dwarf will consent to ride a little further?&quot; he added with a sideways glance at Gimli.</P>

<P>I extended my hand and heaved Gimli up behind me once again, smiling inwardly at his muttered complaints, which continued until we reached the spot Gandalf had pointed out.  We made sure the horses had access to some grass, then Aragorn volunteered to make a fire, sending Gimli and myself to search out some food.</P>

<P>Gimli stomped into the trees ahead of me.  &quot;How does he expect us to find any game in the dark?&quot;</P>

<P>The dwarf’s heavy footfalls made the ground reverberate around him, and a rustle from some bushes up ahead told me he had disturbed something.  In a flash, I brought up my bow, nocked an arrow and let it fly.  It connected with something; I followed the thunk of impact and triumphantly held aloft a rabbit.</P>

<P>&quot;The combination of your noise and my bow seems to work quite successfully,&quot; I commented with a smile.  Gimli merely harrumphed.</P>

<P>We managed to flush out two more rabbits, and stumbled across some mushrooms on our way back to the camp, which provided a meagre but welcome supper.</P>

<P>There was little conversation over the meal, as we all contemplated the events in which we were now caught up.  I wondered what new obstacles we would face in Edoras, and marvelled at how the fate of this kingdom of men had become my concern.  The quest had already taken far more turns than I had expected and now it seemed we were to take up an entirely different path, though still with the same ultimate aim.  I thought about Sam and Frodo alone in the wilderness carrying the heaviest burden of all, and of Merry and Pippin discovering a world of wonders and terrors far beyond their imaginings.  So much had already happened to all of us, but I feared there would be much more danger and sorrow yet to be endured.</P>

<P>After we had finished eating, Gandalf left the immediate area of the camp to stand, shrouded in mist, staring out over the plain.  A moment later, Aragorn rose smoothly to his feet and went to join the wizard.  They began speaking in low tones.</P>

<P>Gimli turned to me.  &quot;We set out to escort young Frodo to Mordor, but failed to complete that when he gave us the slip,&quot; he said, telling me that his thoughts had been following a similar path to mine.  &quot;Then we went back in the opposite direction, chasing after different hobbits who have apparently managed to rescue themselves without our help.  And now we’ve turned round again to help some addled king at the behest of a probably even more addled wizard.&quot;  He crossed his arms over his broad chest.  &quot;All this zig-zagging about and changing our minds is making me dizzy – and we’re not actually getting anything done!&quot;</P>

<P>I could understand his frustration, but I had confidence that our part in the bigger picture would eventually become clear.</P>

<P>&quot;Gandalf has some plan for us, I am sure,&quot; I told Gimli.  &quot;He knows and sees more than he has imparted to us.</P>

<P>Gimli looked at me intently.  &quot;And what do you see, Master Elf?&quot; he asked.</P>

<P>I looked inward, reaching for faint wisps of premonition that swirled around my mind.  &quot;Darkness and light.  A great struggle ahead.  Tiny scattered forces of good taking up arms against overwhelming evil.  Hope is elusive, yet the battle must be joined.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli snorted at my fragmented utterance.  &quot;Plenty to look forward to, then,&quot; he said with heavy sarcasm.  &quot;In the meantime, I’m going to get some sleep.&quot;</P>

<P>He lay down and was snoring in moments.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Edoras rose up from the surrounding plains like a crown from a bed of green velvet.  The golden hall at the summit of the hill shone out as a beacon of civilisation in the wilderness, but Gandalf’s assessment of the situation there suggested that its smooth exterior hid chaos within.  Shadowfax paused once we were within view of the city and Gandalf offered some more information.</P>

<P>&quot;Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.  There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown.  Saruman’s hold over King Theoden is now very strong.  Be careful what you say.  Do not look for welcome here.&quot;</P>

<P>It seemed that Saruman yet threw obstacles in our path at every turn.  While Frodo and Sam bent their steps towards Mordor and the evil of Sauron, our foe was closer at hand and perhaps even more insidious.  That Saruman should have power over one of the leaders of men was ill news indeed, though the bitterness of the Rohan warriors we had met had prepared me somewhat for a hostile reception here.</P>

<P>We rode up to the summit, passing subdued and black-clad people, who watched us ride past in grim silence.  There was little of the movement and bustle you would expect in a city and the atmosphere was heavy with gloom.</P>

<P>Gimli commented to me in his usual, direct manner, &quot;You’ll find more cheer in a graveyard.&quot;  Though I might not have said it aloud, I could not disagree with him and, by the time we reached the Golden Hall, I was apprehensive and on edge.</P>

<P>We left the horses with some attendants but, as we approached the doors of the hall on foot, a group of stone-faced guards came out to bar our entrance.</P>

<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; Gandalf greeted them happily, seemingly ignoring any sign that all was not well.  He was once more cloaked in grey and, along with the cloak, he had also thrown over himself the manner of a genial old man, and I began to understand his intention.</P>

<P>One of the guards stepped forwards and announced, &quot;I cannot allow you before Theoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame…  By order of Grima Wormtongue.&quot;</P>

<P>This was not a name I had heard before, but it had an ill sound and I wondered that the king himself should not have the authority to set down the rules of entrance to his own hall.  Gandalf frowned, but nodded to each of us, indicating that we should do as the man asked.  I was not willing to appear altogether submissive to their demands so, perhaps a little childishly, I drew my knives with a flourish and brandished them for a moment before handing them over.  I was very much loath to give up my Lothlorien bow to such unfriendly hosts, but I had faith that Gandalf was in control of the situation so I reluctantly acquiesced.</P>

<P>Thus disarmed, we made to go in, but the guard was not yet satisfied.  He gestured to Gandalf and protested, &quot;Your staff.&quot;</P>

<P>With an air of absent-mindedness, Gandalf looked at the item as if he had forgotten he was carrying it, then replied, &quot;Hmm?  Oh.  You would not part an old man from his – walking stick.&quot;  Despite the innocent tone, it was a statement rather than a request and I sensed that he put some power into the words to persuade, for the guard nodded and gestured for us to follow him inside.</P>

<P>I saw Gandalf wink at Aragorn and my confidence grew.  In fact, rather than use it for support, Gandalf lowered his staff so as not to draw attention to it and, instead, took my arm in his pretence of infirmity.</P>

<P>The hall was large and the architecture ornate, but it was the people that grabbed my attention.  There were men lining each side and I took note of their positions in case things should turn nasty.  At the front, the king sat on his throne, and such a weak and wizened creature I had never before seen.  An unsavoury character was at his side, an unpleasant-looking man with pasty skin and greasy hair, who looked at us with great suspicion before leaning in close and murmuring something to the king.  I assumed this must be the very Wormtongue referred to outside.  As he spoke, the doors of the hall slammed behind us and I instinctively turned to see that our escape route had been shut off.</P>

<P>Gandalf called out, his voice strong and stern.  &quot;The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Theoden-King.&quot;</P>

<P>The sycophant at the king’s side murmured something else, and then the king spoke up himself in a voice that was wavering and laboured.  &quot;Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?&quot;</P>

<P>He looked to his advisor as if for approval of his words, and the man gave it, saying, &quot;A just question, my liege.&quot;  He rose then and walked out into the main part of the hall towards us.  &quot;Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.  <I>Lathspell</I> I name him.  Ill news is an ill guest.&quot;</P>

<P>It may be that we had arrived after circumstances had turned sour in Edoras, but I hoped we would be in time to save the king and his people from the influence of this evil creature.</P>

<P>&quot;Be silent!&quot; Gandalf commanded.  &quot;Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.  I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!&quot;  It seemed that the time for deception was almost over as Gandalf now raised his staff and pointed it directly at Wormtongue, his identity confirmed in my mind by Gandalf’s words.</P>

<P>Wormtongue recoiled slightly and gasped, &quot;His staff…&quot;  Then he turned fearful wrath on the guards.  &quot;I told you to take the wizard’s staff!&quot;</P>

<P>At this admonishment, the guards rushed out from the edges of the hall, presumably in an attempt to rectify their mistake.  They did not even get close to Gandalf, however, as Aragorn, Gimli and I defeated them easily, even without our weapons.  Wormtongue hurried out of the way, and Gandalf advanced, unhindered, on the throne.</P>

<P>&quot;Theoden, son of Thengel,&quot; he said clearly.  &quot;Too long have you sat in the shadows.&quot;</P>

<P>I glanced around to track Wormtongue’s position, but relaxed when I saw him squirming on the floor under Gimli’s sturdy boot.  He looked understandably terrified when the dwarf told him to stay still in a threatening tone.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Gandalf raised up his hand towards Theoden and continued with growing power in his voice, &quot;Hearken to me!  I release you from the spell.&quot;</P>

<P>But the king merely let out an unsettling, mad laugh and countered in a far stronger voice than before, &quot;You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey.&quot;</P>

<P>Gandalf’s response was to throw aside his grey cloak, revealing the pure white robes beneath it, and this caused the king to draw back and exclaim in surprise.</P>

<P>&quot;I shall draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound,&quot; Gandalf vowed, and suddenly the conflict took on a personal edge as the wizard faced down his nemesis.</P>

<P>At that moment, a young woman with golden hair streaming down her back rushed in from the side and headed up towards the throne.  Before she could interrupt the power struggle between the two wizards, however, Aragorn caught her and held her back.  She fought him for a moment, but a soft command to wait stilled her.</P>

<P>A different voice, that of Saruman I surmised, now came from the king.  &quot;If I go, Theoden dies,&quot; he threatened, but Gandalf was not swayed.</P>

<P>&quot;You did not kill me, you will not kill him,&quot; he replied and his words were full of conviction.</P>

<P>&quot;Rohan is mine!&quot; Saruman shrieked, but I could hear desperation in his tone, as if he knew he had met his match.</P>

<P>&quot;Be gone!&quot; Gandalf commanded.  When the king then lunged off his throne, Gandalf thrust his staff forwards, forcing him back without ever touching him.  Theoden slammed into the back of the chair and then crumpled, folding forwards as though about to collapse.</P>

<P>Aragorn now released the girl and she hurried to the king’s side, supporting him gently and helping him back into an upright position.  He was breathing heavily, but he looked around the hall as if waking from a dream and then, before our eyes, the signs of age gradually fell from his face, leaving a strong and vital man of middle years in their place.</P>

<P>He looked into the eyes of the young woman, who still knelt at his side, and said uncertainly, &quot;I know your face.&quot;  He paused as if trying to remember something and then suddenly smiled.  &quot;Eowyn… Eowyn.&quot;</P>

<P>Her answering smile was wonderful to see, and I knew in that moment that we had succeeded in our task of freeing the king.  Rohan had regained its leader and now, perhaps, the nation of horse lords would be allies for us in our continuing struggle.</P>

<P>Gandalf stepped forward, drawing the king’s attention to him.</P>

<P>Theoden questioned, &quot;Gandalf?&quot;  That single word contained an enquiry both as to the wizard’s presence there and what had just transpired.</P>

<P>&quot;Breathe the free air again, my friend,&quot; Gandalf replied with obvious satisfaction in his victory over Saruman.</P>

<P>&quot;Dark have been my dreams of late,&quot; Theoden said, his face troubled.</P>

<P>Gandalf prompted him, saying, &quot;Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.&quot;</P>

<P>His authority extended itself to Theoden’s men, one of whom immediately stepped forward and offered the king the hilt of a sheathed sword.  Theoden reached for it slightly hesitantly, but his confidence grew as he drew the blade.  It was a masterful weapon, ornate but strong, a fitting blade for a king.  Theoden then turned an angry gaze on Wormtongue, who was still under Gimli’s firm control.</P>

<P>The king snarled and commanded his men, &quot;Get that snake out of here!&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli stepped aside as two of the Rohirrim grabbed Wormtongue and dragged him between them to the doors.  We all followed them out, Theoden continuing down as Wormtongue was flung down the steps to grovel at the bottom.  I remained above, looking on from the platform outside the hall, Gimli on one side of me and the Lady Eowyn on the other.  Beneath her calm and poised exterior, I could sense she was a mass of jumbled fear, joy and confusion, but there was no opportunity for introductions or explanations as the confrontation between king and parasite played out below us.</P>

<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; Wormtongue cried, scrabbling for purchase both physically and mentally.  &quot;I’ve only… ever… served you, my lord.&quot;</P>

<P>But Theoden was now wholly free of his influence, and anger lent strength to both his voice and his still uncertain limbs.  &quot;Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!&quot; he growled, fury and humiliation spurring his words in equal measure.</P>

<P>&quot;Send me not from your sight!&quot; Wormtongue begged, though why he should wish to stay at Edoras now that his power had been destroyed, I do not know.  Perhaps he hoped to re-establish some control over time, or perhaps the thought of facing Saruman in failure was a worse prospect than any punishment Theoden might mete out.</P>

<P>That punishment seemed for a moment to be death, as the king raised his sword to strike, but suddenly Aragorn was at his side, stopping the blow before it fell.</P>

<P>&quot;No, my lord!  No, my lord,&quot; the voice of reason urged from Aragorn’s lips.  &quot;Enough blood has been spilled on his account.&quot;</P>

<P>Seeing his opportunity and presumably deciding escape was the best course at this point, Wormtongue began to rise.  Aragorn reached out and offered him a hand, but the vile creature merely spat at him before scrambling to his feet and running down the hill, shoving people out of the way as he went.</P>

<P>By now, quite a crowd of people had gathered at the foot of the stairs and the man who had given the king his sword stepped forward to announce their leader’s return to his senses.</P>

<P>&quot;Hail, Theoden-King!&quot; he cried, and all the people knelt, including Aragorn, who thus acknowledged Theoden’s authority over all within his realm.</P>

<P>Theoden paid little attention to his subjects, instead turning and looking back up to where Gandalf stood.  As if suddenly remembering something important, he asked, &quot;Where is Theodred?  Where is my son?&quot;</P>

<P>I felt Eowyn tense beside me and a low moan of despair escaped her lips, telling me the answer to the king’s question before it was revealed.  Theoden was free of Saruman’s control, but that was not the end to grief and pain for Rohan.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Theodred’s funeral was a sombre affair, the people who lined the route from the city to the tomb were downtrodden and defeated.  It was as if the hope of Rohan had died with its heir.  I was uncomfortable being at the forefront of such an occasion among strangers, but I had the feeling that there would be many more deaths to come for the people of Rohan and that, when they occurred, they might no longer be strangers to me.</P>

<P>As the body was passed from the men into the hands of the women and thence into the tomb, Eowyn sang a lament for her cousin.  It was not as graceful as the one for Gandalf we had heard in Lothlorien, but it was just as heartfelt, and it pained me that this was the only music we had occasion for in these dark times.</P>

<P>After the ceremony, I walked back up to the city with Gimli and Aragorn.  Despite my professed confidence in Gandalf’s leadership, I was still uncertain and I felt the need of my friends’ counsel.</P>

<P>&quot;What now is our purpose here&quot; I asked them.  &quot;We have freed the king and set him back upon his throne, but where do our steps lead us next?  Sam and Frodo are now far beyond our aid, and even Merry and Pippin have found their own path, whatever it may be.  What role are we to play in the continuing struggle?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I do not know,&quot; Aragorn replied honestly.  &quot;When we set out from Rivendell, our objective was clear, but now events have taken unexpected turns and we are no longer part of the original quest.&quot;  He laid a hand on my shoulder, reaffirming my earlier thoughts on the matter.  &quot;We must trust to the hobbits to follow their own course to whatever end without our help, and we shall follow Gandalf’s lead wherever it takes us.  I am certain he knows more than he had told us and I am just as certain that he will reveal our new purpose when the time is right.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just so long as it doesn’t involve any more running,&quot; Gimli grumbled.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>In fact, it was not Gandalf but two young children who pointed our steps towards their next destination.  They had journeyed a long way, all alone, by the time they reached Edoras.  It was Gandalf who saw them first, exhausted and frightened, making their way towards the city on a horse that was far too big for them.</P>

<P>When they had been brought into the hall, Eowyn quickly took charge of finding them food and warm clothing; I think she was glad to have something practical to do, something on which to focus her flailing emotions.</P>

<P>The rest of us gathered to discuss the news the children had brought of wild men descending from out of the mountains to burn their village.  While the two children ate soup, Gimli had somehow managed to procure himself a plate of meat and bread, his attention much more on eating than on the conversation, but Aragorn and I listened intently as Eowyn railed against this new invasion of her land.</P>

<P>&quot;They had no warning.  They were unarmed,&quot; she protested.  &quot;Now the wildmen are moving through the westfold, burning as they go.  Rick, cot and tree.&quot;</P>

<P>She was still dressed in the sombre finery she had donned for her cousin’s funeral, her hair elaborately pinned at her neck, and she presented an impressive picture of combined strength and emotion.</P>

<P>The little girl asked for her mother, but was quieted, her plaintive query having no place in what was essentially a council of war.  And yet, she represented the very future of Rohan that we were trying to save and so added further urgency to our deliberations.</P>

<P>Gandalf was sitting at Theoden’s right hand, in the place recently occupied by Wormtongue.  I wondered if that was deliberate and silently questioned its wisdom as an attempt to influence the king.</P>

<P>&quot;This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash,&quot; the wizard warned.  &quot;All the more potent for he is driven mad by fear of Sauron.  Ride out and meet him head on,&quot; he urged.  &quot;Draw him away from your women and children.  You must fight.&quot;</P>

<P>The king looked unconvinced, so Aragorn joined the debate.  &quot;You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak.  Eomer is loyal to you.&quot;</P>

<P>Theoden rose abruptly from his throne and moved down into the main part of the hall, as if trying to escape the problem.  When he spoke, his tone was despairing.  &quot;They will be three hundred leagues from here by now.  Eomer cannot help us.&quot;  Then he turned and fixed Gandalf with a wary glare.  &quot;I know what it is you want of me.  But I will not bring further death to my people.  I will not risk open war.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn countered his caution and I could hear the frustration in his voice.  &quot;Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.&quot;</P>

<P>But this only seemed to make the king defensive.  &quot;When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan,&quot; he snapped.  I could understand his desire to re-establish his autonomy and not seem as if he had merely exchanged one form of manipulation for another, but this statement seemed almost petulant to me, in light of the situation. </P>

<P>I was distracted at this point when Gimli’s complete lack of table manners resulted in him spilling ale all down his beard and letting out an almighty belch.  His opinion of the proceedings seemed altogether clear and I found myself sharing it, though not so openly.</P>

<P>Gandalf demonstrated almost infinite patience, calmly asking, &quot;Then what is the king’s decision?&quot;</P>

<P>There was silence for a moment, then Theoden turned to his second-in-command, who had been standing silently at the side of the hall throughout.  &quot;We will make for Helm’s Deep and take refuge there,&quot; he announced, all but ignoring us in the issuing of his orders.  &quot;Spread the message to the people to collect only what is necessary for the journey and gather at the city gates.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, my liege,&quot; the warrior replied, and made for the doors to the outside.</P>

<P>Theoden glanced once at Gandalf, as if daring him to interfere, then swept out in the direction of his quarters.  Eowyn looked torn, as if trying to decide whether or not to follow him, but then she turned her attention back to the children.</P>

<P>Gandalf rose from his seat on the dais.  &quot;If Theoden will not send riders out to find Eomer, I will go myself,&quot; he announced.  &quot;Come, we shall make our own plans.&quot;</P>

<P>We followed him out into the city and across to the stables.  Once outside the hall, Gimli finally spoke his mind.  &quot;Helm’s Deep!  They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.  Who will defend them if not their king?&quot;</P>

<P>Unexpectedly, Aragorn defended Theoden’s decision.  &quot;He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people.  Helm’s Deep has saved them in the past.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli harrumphed, clearly not convinced, then hesitated in the doorway with me while Aragorn and Gandalf continued on to Shadowfax’s stall.</P>

<P>&quot;Saruman won’t leave them alone just because they’re sealed in a fortress,&quot; the dwarf rumbled.  &quot;Rohan will be forced to fight eventually, you’ll see.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And it looks as though we shall be fighting with them,&quot; I replied.</P>

<P>I was not wholly comfortable with following Theoden to Helm’s Deep, but if it was Gandalf’s will and where Aragorn was going, I would do so.  Gimli did not look pleased at the prospect either, but I knew he would not leave us now.  We were bound to see out this battle together and would weather it side by side.</P>

<P>Our contemplation of the immediate future was interrupted as Gandalf’s exit from the stable on Shadowfax forced us to step aside.  I watched him ride away with growing apprehension.  The return of Gandalf had given me great confidence and I had once again felt as if we had some control over our own fates, and perhaps even those of all the free peoples of Middle Earth.  Now that he was leaving us once more, doubt immediately began to creep back into my heart, and I wondered if we would ever see him again.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The mobilisation of an entire city was no simple task and the preparations for the journey stretched out over the rest of the day.  Aragorn, Gimli and I offered our help where we could, but I felt very much out of place amongst the families who were packing up to leave their homes, perhaps forever.  By evening, I was glad to escape to my room, though sleep did not come quickly to me that night.</P>

<P>The following morning, we set out in a long train from Edoras, Gimli taking his now customary place behind me on Arod, the horse given to us by the Rohan warrior we now knew to be Eowyn’s brother.  The horse seemed happy to be among other familiar beasts again and stepped out eagerly on the rocky trail.</P>

<P>Now that we were finally on our way, the mood was lighter and Eowyn in particular began to come out of her shell.  I noticed that, no matter who was taking part in the conversation, her gaze kept coming back to Aragorn, who seemed oblivious to her regard.  I sensed a growing attachment for him in the young noblewoman and wondered how many others would fall for the handsome ranger before he settled down with Arwen.  I knew from long experience that his love for the elf maiden would not be shaken, regardless of whether they could eventually be together, but Eowyn was ignorant of his prior attachment and so was reckless with her affection.</P>

<P>While I understood all too well the effect Aragorn could unknowingly have on a young heart in search of an object, Eowyn’s attentions to him began to aggravate me.  In a way that seeing him with Arwen never had, watching Eowyn flirt with Aragorn made my own heart ache with its unrequited desire.  I also became worried that Eowyn might discover my feelings for Aragorn, as I had hers, and I was unwilling to share them with a virtual stranger.  Suddenly, and perhaps childishly, I felt the need to escape my friends and our new acquaintances, and lose myself in the crowd.</P>

<P>Making the excuse that Arod was probably tired of carrying double and there was no need for me to ride when we were travelling at walking pace, I dismounted and started to move forwards through the line.  Anonymity soon proved impossible, the people staring openly at me as I passed.  They had not yet become accustomed to seeing an elf among them and their blatant curiosity did nothing to improve my mood.  I soon found myself at the front of the main column of travellers and took up a solitary position between them and the two mounted outriders, who scouted our path some distance ahead.</P>

<P>Here, I could be alone with my thoughts, but I found it impossible to dwell on the melancholy that had prompted me to reject the company of my friends.  The peace and steady progression of the journey soon restored my equanimity and I began to enjoy the light exertion.  I realised that this was essentially the first time I had been alone since leaving Rivendell.  I was under no illusion that reaching Helm’s Deep would be an end to all our troubles, but the brief respite of the journey thither released some of the tension of the previous few weeks.</P>

<P>By the time a halt was called for food and rest, I was already feeling quite rested, at least mentally, but I was loath to give up my solitude just yet so I did not rejoin my friends in the makeshift camp, instead staying on the fringes.  I do not know if they wondered at my absence, but no-one came in search of me so I passed an the time in meditation, content in my own company.</P>

<P>It was during the second leg of the journey that all peace was shattered.  I set out with renewed energy and outstripped even the forward riders when we broke camp, but some sense of impending danger began to cloud my mind as the sun gradually descended in the sky.  As I topped a small rise of land and saw a rocky ridge stretching out before me alongside our path, I distinctly felt I was being watched and I stopped to scan the surroundings for a possible ambush.</P>

<P>The outriders, whose names I had learned were Gamling and Hama, came up on my position as I stood there and passed me, urging their horses down the hill.  The beasts must have sensed the danger too, since they balked and squealed a protest at venturing further.</P>

<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; Gamling asked nervously.  &quot;Hama?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’m not sure,&quot; his companion replied.</P>

<P>I started down after them but, before I could reach them, a creature leapt from the ridge to the left and landed squarely on top of Hama, knocking over his horse.  It killed Hama with one snap of its mighty jaws as I raced in vain to his aid.  Gamling drew his sword, shouted, &quot;Wargs!&quot; and engaged the creature’s orc rider in battle.</P>

<P>Now within easy range, I nocked an arrow and aimed at the warg as the greatest threat.  It fell, throwing its rider to the ground, where he lay stunned, allowing me to despatch him with a slice of my knife across his throat.  I turned back towards my fellow travellers then and saw Aragorn standing at the top of the rise of land behind me.</P>

<P>&quot;A scout!&quot; I called to him, then raced onwards to the next rise.  As I topped it, more wargs came into view, charging towards me.  I heard shouting and hoofbeats behind me, but I kept my focus on shooting as many of the beasts as I could before they reached the main body of Rohan people.</P>

<P>As he sound of horses grew nearer, I turned to see Gimli bearing down on me with Arod and I swung myself up in front of him as they galloped past.  I let the horse control his own direction, trusting that a Rohan mount would know what to do in a battle, and I continued to lay waste to the enemy with my bow.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, Arod’s erratic movements proved too much for Gimli’s limited horseriding abilities and he fell from Arod’s back with a curse.  I immediately wheeled the horse round to go back for him, only to see a riderless warg making for his position.  Another arrow made short work of the beast, but Gimli was less than grateful.</P>

<P>Axe raised, he snarled at me, &quot;That one counts as mine!&quot;</P>

<P>I figured that meant he was quite capable of taking care of himself, even on the ground, so I shrugged and took Arod off to a different part of the battle.  On all sides, orcs on wargs waged war with the mounted Rohirrim, sword against spear.  The wargs were very agile and aggressive, but the bond between the Rohan warriors and their horses made them a formidable foe.  Numbers were also in our favour and it was not long before all the orcs were dead or incapacitated, and the remaining wargs fled the field as soon as their masters were no longer commanding them.  We had suffered numerous casualties ourselves and I dismounted from Arod to seek out my friends amidst the bodies from the battle.</P>

<P>I realised I had not seen Aragorn since the very beginning of the engagement and a sudden icy chill stabbed at my heart, flooding my mind with unreasoning fear.</P>

<P>&quot;Aragorn?&quot; I called out urgently and heard Gimli echoing my cry from nearby.</P>

<P>The sound of laughter reached my ears and I tracked it to an orc lying on the grass near the edge of a cliff.  He was badly wounded but clearly enjoying our concern for our friend.  Gimli came up beside me and placed the blade of his axe at the orc’s throat.</P>

<P>&quot;Tell me what happened and I’ll ease your passing,&quot; he growled.</P>

<P>The orc laughed again, a sick bubbling sound making it clear he did not have long to live.  &quot;He’s… dead,&quot; he croaked.  &quot;He took a little tumble off the cliff.&quot;</P>

<P>Anger, fear and sorrow washed over me in a wave that caused my legs to buckle and I knelt down, grabbing the orc’s shoulders and shaking him roughly.</P>

<P>&quot;You lie!&quot; I accused, unable to entertain any thought of the alternative.</P>

<P>The creature grinned up at me and then breathed its last.  As his hand fell to his side, something shiny caught the light and I reached down to pull the Evenstar from his grasp.  I exchanged a horrified glance with Gimli and ran to the edge of the cliff, where Theoden was already looking down.  Far below us, a fast-moving river flowed over treacherous rocks and my heart lurched at the impossibility of anyone surviving such a fall.  I sensed Gimli at my side but I could not take my eyes off the water below, all thought and feeling frozen in an unwillingness to accept that Aragorn could really be gone.</P>

<P>Theoden broke the silence, issuing orders to his men.  &quot;Get the wounded on horses.  The wolves of Isengard will return.  Leave the dead.&quot;</P>

<P>I looked up at him in angry disbelief and he returned my gaze with compassionate sorrow in his eyes.  The thought of leaving Aragorn alone out in the wilderness, even if he was dead, turned me cold, but the practical part of my brain that was still functioning pointed out the necessity of moving on as quickly as possible.</P>

<P>Theoden placed a hand on my shoulder and said, &quot;Come&quot;, but I was rooted to the spot.  In the end, a subdued Gimli literally pulled me away from the cliff edge.  I remounted Arod in a daze and just let him follow the rest of the horses away from the battlefield.</P>

<P>I do not remember the rest of the journey.  No words passed between myself and Gimli, but his solid presence behind me on the horse told me that he shared my grief.  I was numb, my thoughts whirling, my body moving purely mechanically as I tried in vain to come to terms with never seeing Aragorn again.</P>

<P>Eowyn ran out to meet us when we finally reached Helm’s Deep.  Her despair at our obvious losses had no effect upon me, lost as I was in my own grief.  I saw Gimli approach her but had no desire to hear him impart our grave news; I threw Arod’s reins to someone and fled through the city, seeking solitude once more.  Perhaps I should have stayed, perhaps I should have sought and given comfort with those who shared my sorrow, but I was selfish in my loss, thinking that no-one could feel Aragorn’s death as I did and unwilling to acknowledge that others were affected by it too.  My mind shied away from any thought of Arwen, instead focusing only on myself.</P>

<P>I did not pay attention to where I was going, but I soon found myself atop the battlements of the city.  I stood at the wall, looking out over the hills but seeing nothing.  I knew that I would stand beside Gimli, perhaps in that very spot, and defend the people within those walls with my life, because that was what I had pledged to do.  But our struggle no longer held any meaning for me, and a small part of me even hoped that I would lose my own life in the battle.</P>

<P>After I had been standing there a long while, I felt a presence at my side and looked round into Eowyn’s red-rimmed eyes.  The very connection I had shied away from on entering Helm’s Deep was forged between us in that brief instant and it released something inside me that had been wound up too tight since the fight with the wargs.  I sank down to the ground and sat with my back against the wall, Eowyn dropping to sit beside me.  She laid a hand on my arm and the warmth of her compassion began slowly to dispel the chill from my body.</P>

<P>&quot;Did you love him?&quot;  Her soft voice penetrated the thick fog in my brain and I answered her honestly.</P>

<P>&quot;More than my own life.&quot;  I looked across at her again, my own compassion awoken by hers.  &quot;Did you?&quot;</P>

<P>She offered up a sad smile and was honest in her turn.  &quot;I was only just beginning to know him.  But I think I could have loved him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;His heart belonged to another,&quot; I told her, but she nodded, indicating that she had already known.  Thoughts of Arwen suddenly flooded my mind and a new grief sprang up in my heart.  &quot;She entrusted his safety to me and I promised I would watch over him while she could not,&quot; I revealed.  &quot;How can I now go back to her and tell her what has happened?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If their love was as strong as it seemed to be, she will already know,&quot; Eowyn replied.  &quot;You must go to her and tell her that you were with Aragorn in his final battle and that he fought with honour to protect those who could not protect themselves.&quot;</P>

<P>I nodded; she was right.  It was another burden, a new responsibility for me to discharge, but it would have to be done.  I could not leave Arwen to suffer alone with no knowledge of what had befallen the man we both loved.</P>

<P>At that moment, there was a shout from one of the sentries.  &quot;A lone rider approaches the city!&quot;</P>

<P>Eowyn and I scrambled to our feet and I searched the ground below to find the solitary figure.  My heart soared as I immediately recognised Aragorn, a surge of combined relief and disbelief flooding through me.  I turned to Eowyn, who clearly could not see far enough to know it was him.</P>

<P>&quot;It is Aragorn!&quot; I cried.  &quot;He’s alive!&quot;</P>

<P>Shock registered first on her face, then pure, unadulterated joy.  Her eyes swam with tears and she embraced me tightly, her body trembling with emotion.  A moment later and she transformed into the poised princess I had first met.</P>

<P>Turning to the sentry, she instructed him, &quot;Send word to Theoden-King and the dwarf, Gimli, that Lord Aragorn has returned from the battlefield.  Make sure the keepers of the gate are prepared to receive him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, my lady,&quot; was the prompt reply.</P>

<P>Then the smile was back on Eowyn’s face and she clutched my arm in excitement.  My gaze was fixed on Aragorn, my eyes drinking in the evidence of his survival, even while my mind struggled to believe it.  He looked very weary, and he swayed as if he was staying atop his horse by will power alone, but he was whole and breathing and that was enough for me.  As soon as he passed out of sight beneath the wall, I took Eowyn’s hand and we made our way back to the citadel to receive the returning hero.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>I was standing outside the great hall when Aragorn reached the centre of the citadel.  He nearly walked right into me, he was so focused on simply staying upright.  The urge to just take him in my arms and never let go was so strong it nearly took my breath away but, when he pulled up short right in front of me, I merely looked him in the eye and said in Elvish, &quot;<I>You’re late.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>He seemed dazed and it took him a moment to register what I’d said.  Confusion at my nonchalance swamped his face and he didn’t seem to know how to handle it.  I looked him up and down, taking in the dirt, the sweat and the blood – more than a little of it his, I was sure – and carefully maintained my casual tone.</P>

<P>&quot;You look terrible,&quot; I said.</P>

<P>At that, Aragorn suddenly grinned and actually chuckled, something I had not heard in a very long time.  He reached up to place a hand on my shoulder and my resolve nearly cracked.  I think he must have noticed some change in my expression because his eyes darkened with an unknown sorrow and he looked as though he was going to say something.</P>

<P>I forestalled him, not wanting to know what was in his mind, and directed his focus onto another object entirely; namely, the Evenstar, which I placed into his unsuspecting hand.  He looked down at it in surprise and then up at me in wonder, and I read an unspoken understanding in his expression of what that moment was costing me.  I smiled then, trying to convey to him that I knew exactly where I stood and would never begrudge him his choice.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Thank you</I>,&quot; he said in Elvish and his tone told me he spoke of more than simply the return of the jewel.</P>

<P>He clutched my shoulder and I tried to will some of my strength into his weary body, knowing that he would not rest until all his duties had been discharged.  He closed his eyes briefly and I could see him drawing up the last of his reserves.  Then, he took a deep breath and moved past me to push open the double doors of the great hall.</P>

<P>He lost no time in imparting his news, striding right up to the throne and stating, &quot;My Lord, there is an army marching upon Helm’s Deep, a great host of Uruk-hai, sent by Saruman.&quot;</P>

<P>Theoden’s immediate reaction was lost in the distraction of Gimli entering the hall and joining me at Aragorn’s side.</P>

<P>&quot;A great host, you say?&quot; Theoden prompted.</P>

<P>Aragorn elaborated.  &quot;All Isengard is emptied.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How many?&quot;  Theoden seemed sceptical of the resources Saruman had at his disposal.  I knew that, if Aragorn was worried, the army had to be sizeable, but the actual figure shocked us all.</P>

<P>&quot;Ten thousand strong at least.&quot;</P>

<P>Theoden spluttered an incredulous echo.  &quot;Ten thousand?&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn’s tone took on an insistent edge.  &quot;It is an army bred for a single purpose, to destroy the world of men.  They will be here by nightfall.&quot;</P>

<P>Theoden’s expression hardened.  &quot;Let them come.&quot;</P>

<P>With that, he strode out of the throne room to survey his dwindling realm, with the three of us following behind him.  He issued instructions to one of his lieutenants as he walked.</P>

<P>&quot;I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.&quot;  We reached the gate and stepped out on the causeway, Theoden’s attention transferring to Aragorn.  &quot;We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.&quot;  He sounded confident, his moment of apprehension at the size of Saruman’s army all but forgotten.  &quot;No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli’s evident impatience at his complacence broke through and he commented forcefully, &quot;This is no rabble of mindless orcs.  These are Uruk-hai.  Their armour is thick and their shields broad.&quot;</P>

<P>But, true to form when he felt his authority was being threatened, Theoden was not about to be counselled by caution.  &quot;I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.  I know how to defend my own keep.&quot;  He moved back inside it, continuing his survey.  &quot;They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.  Saruman’s hordes will pillage and burn.  We’ve seen it before.  Crops can be resown, homes rebuilt.  Within these walls, we will outlast them.&quot;</P>

<P>By this time, we were up on the battlements.  I could see Aragorn’s frustration in the set of his shoulders, but the argument meant little to me.  I was still warmed by his return from the dead and I was only walking with them because I feared to let him out of my sight again.  His passion burst forth once more, and I admired the determination with which he tried to persuade the stubborn old man who ruled the people we found ourselves amongst.</P>

<P>&quot;They do not come to destroy Rohan’s crops or villages.  They come to destroy its people – down to the last child!&quot;</P>

<P>Theoden finally reacted, spinning on his heel and grabbing Aragorn’s arm.  When he spoke, it was in a low voice so as to avoid making a scene in front of his men, but his irritation was clear in his tone.</P>

<P>&quot;What would you have me do?&quot; he demanded, revealing that perhaps he realised the severity of the situation after all.  &quot;Look at my men.  Their courage hangs by a thread.  If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!&quot;  He turned away again, resuming his walk along the battlements.</P>

<P>Aragorn was not prepared to give up hope of survival so easily.  &quot;Send out riders, my lord,&quot; he almost pleaded.  &quot;You must call for aid.&quot;</P>

<P>Turning once more to face us, Theoden gestured at Gimli and myself and replied with some bitterness, &quot;And who will come?  Elves?  Dwarves?  We are not so lucky in our friends as you.  The old alliances are dead.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gondor will answer.&quot;  Aragorn was certain, but it seemed the ties between the kingdoms of men were no longer strong either.</P>

<P>&quot;Gondor?&quot; Theoden questioned.  &quot;Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?  Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?  Where was Gon-&quot;  He broke off, then concluded pessimistically, &quot;No, my lord Aragorn.  We are alone.&quot;  With that, he stalked off and Aragorn did not follow him.</P>

<P>I wondered then if Saruman had indeed already won dominion over the realms of men, if this was the attitude they had towards one another.  Theoden had decided that the situation was hopeless and refused to consider any alternatives to his own doom-laden view.</P>

<P>Aragorn rubbed his hands over his face, his shoulders slumped with weariness.  He turned to face me and swayed slightly, the focus of his eyes drifting away from mine for a moment.  I reached out a hand to steady him and watched as he drew up the remaining dregs of his endurance, his determination to carry on obvious in the set of his features.  I knew he was not prepared to sit by and simply wait for the Uruk-hai to come and slaughter us all, not without at least devising the best defence he could.  He led Gimli and me through the crowds of people heading into the keep, indicating his plan with hand gestures as he went.</P>

<P>&quot;We’ll place reserves along the wall.  They can support the archers from above the gate.&quot;</P>

<P>But who would support Aragorn when his strength finally gave out?  I tried to get through to him, using the best tactic I could muster and preying on his desire to save the people of Rohan, rather than his own wellbeing.</P>

<P>&quot;Aragorn, you must rest,&quot; I urged.  &quot;You’re no use to us half alive.&quot;  I did not add that I feared he would not survive the battle in his current state and I was not prepared to lose him again.</P>

<P>He had no chance to respond, as Eowyn chose that moment to come running up to us.  This was the first chance she had had to speak to Aragorn since his return and I stepped back slightly into the crowd to give them some space.</P>

<P>&quot;Aragorn!&quot; Eowyn called, her manner agitated, but her topic of conversation was not what I had expected.  &quot;I’m to be sent with the women into the caves,&quot; she continued, her feelings on that decision clear in the bitterness of her tone.</P>

<P>&quot;That is an honourable charge,&quot; Aragorn replied wearily.  He seemed somewhat confused as to what she wanted of him.</P>

<P>&quot;To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return,&quot; Eowyn complained.  &quot;Where is the renown in that?&quot;</P>

<P>She sounded like a petulant child to my ears, and I wondered that she should burden Aragorn with such petty concerns.  Then I considered the stresses she had endured in the last few days and the importance her people placed on military prowess and chided myself for being uncharitable.  To his credit, Aragorn responded cordially, his words carefully chosen so as best to appease her.  </P>

<P>&quot;My lady, a time may come for valour without renown.  Who then will your people look to in the last defence?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let me stand at your side,&quot; she pleaded, but Aragorn shook his head.</P>

<P>&quot;It is not in my power to command it,&quot; he told her, beginning to turn away.</P>

<P>&quot;You do not command the others to stay!&quot; Eowyn cried, her voice rising.  &quot;They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.&quot;  Aragorn turned back in time to see her glance over his shoulder at me, her expression almost envious.  &quot;Because they love you,&quot; she said, then blushed and looked at the ground in confusion.  Before Aragorn could say anything, she muttered, &quot;I’m sorry,&quot; and fled back the way she had come.</P>

<P>Aragorn twisted to look at me, but I could not meet his eye, so I turned quickly away, pretending I had not overheard their conversation, though I knew he would not be fooled.  I was not prepared to deal with any kind of confrontation about anyone’s feelings at that moment, so I chose the route of avoidance.</P>

<P>Gimli had stayed uncharacteristically silent since Theoden’s cutting remarks at the gate, but now he cleared his throat noisily.</P>

<P>&quot;Let’s search out the armoury and see what kind of weaponry this king has to offer,&quot; he suggested.</P>

<P>We made our way back to the keep, and there was tension between us that had never been there before.  I felt as if all my defences had been stripped away and my emotions laid bare for all to see and it was not a state of mind I was used to or remotely enjoyed.  Aragorn was still concentrating almost solely on staying on his feet and I am sure the last thing he needed was to deal with a petulant princess and a lovelorn elf.  I do not know what was running through Gimli’s mind, but I am sure he was uncomfortable with the atmosphere.</P>

<P>We joined a crowd of men – if they could be called that – collecting weapons in the armoury.</P>

<P>Aragorn echoed my thoughts in a low voice.  &quot;Farmers, farriers, stable boys.  These are no soldiers.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Most have seen too many winters,&quot; Gimli agreed.</P>

<P>&quot;Or too few,&quot; I added.  The hopelessness of the situation was beginning to press down on me and my restraint began to falter.  &quot;Look at them.  They’re frightened; I can see it in their eyes.&quot;</P>

<P>My ill-advised and fully audible comment caused all the men to stop in their tracks and glare at me, but I paid them no heed, merely switching to Elvish and continuing my train of thought.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>And they should be.  Three hundred against ten thousand?&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>Aragorn argued back in the same language.  &quot;<I>They have a better chance defending themselves here than in Edoras.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Aragorn, they cannot win this fight,</I>&quot; I countered.  &quot;<I>They are all going to die!</I>&quot;</P>

<P>Again, I didn’t add that it wasn’t them I was really worried about, but he caught my meaning anyway, his own weakening control over his emotions giving way to an outburst.</P>

<P>&quot;Then I shall die as one of them!&quot; he shouted, before spinning on his heel and storming out.</P>

<P>I made to follow him, but Gimli caught hold of my arm and stopped me.</P>

<P>&quot;Let him go, lad,&quot; he said softly.  &quot;Let him be.&quot;</P>

<P>I felt the frustration building inside me and had no wish for an audience to my feelings, so I stalked into an empty side room with Gimli following me.  Once out of sight of the men of Rohan, I sat down in a corner and rested my head in my hands.  I knew, and Aragorn knew, and even Gimli knew that the argument had not been about the defence of Helm’s Deep and it angered me that I had let my personal feelings get the better of me.  I fought to calm myself and see the situation from a more objective viewpoint.  However, no matter how I looked at it, our chances of surviving the night were slim.</P>

<P>Gimli moved to stand beside me and placed a warm hand on my shoulder.  &quot;It’s been a long and trying day,&quot; he said, his deep voice penetrating the fog in my brain and soothing my roiling emotions.  &quot;I think perhaps both of you need a chance to rest and find your balance again.  It does no good for us to fight amongst ourselves when there’s a real enemy battering at the gates.&quot;</P>

<P>I looked up into his affectionate eyes, and spoke the words that were tearing out my heart.  &quot;I thought I’d lost him once, Gimli.  I can’t go through that again.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know, laddie,&quot; he said.  &quot;Believe me, it’s not something I particularly want to experience again, either.  But he gave his word to protect these people and nothing you say or do will ever persuade him to go back on that.  All we can do is stand beside him and help him as best we can.  He needs us to support him; he can’t do this alone.&quot;</P>

<P>I patted Gimli’s hand where it rested on my shoulder and managed a grateful smile.  &quot;You’re right, my friend.  We cannot escape the coming darkness, but we can face it together.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said Gimli, settling himself on the floor beside me, &quot;let us talk of something else while we still can.  How do you suppose those two young rapscallion hobbits are getting along with the trees?&quot;</P>

<P>I couldn’t help but laugh at his question, and the release of tension was a huge relief, unknotting the ball of apprehension that had wound itself up in my stomach.  Suddenly, the prospect of the upcoming battle did not seem so bleak with such a friend at my side.</P>

<P>*  *  *</P>

<P>Some time later, the armoury had cleared of all the would-be soldiers under Theoden’s command as they were all issued with weapons and called out to man the wall.  Gimli and I were just preparing to go in search of Aragorn when we heard him come down the stairs in the outer room.  I scrambled to my feet and went out to join him.  He had his back to me as I entered and I watched him for a moment as he donned his armour with a renewed determination that increased my own restored hope.  I picked up his sword from where it lay on a side table and had it ready to place into his hand when he turned to look for it.  He held my gaze as he took it, his eyes searching mine in slight apprehension.</P>

<P>I dispelled his worries with an apologetic smile and said softly, &quot;We have trusted you this far and you have not led us astray.  Forgive me.  I was wrong to despair.&quot;</P>

<P>His entire demeanour relaxed at my words and his reply in Elvish was heartfelt.  &quot;<I>There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>We clasped arms, comfortable once again in our support of one another, the argument of earlier now forgotten in the face of the imminent challenge.</P>

<P>Gimli interrupted the moment by wandering in from where he had been putting on a mail shirt.  He had managed to get it over his head and was holding up the length at waist height.  He looked up at us, his face troubled.</P>

<P>&quot;If we had time, I’d get this adjusted,&quot; he said, dropping the folds of metal, which fell to pool at his feet.  &quot;It’s a little tight across the chest.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn and I exchanged an amused glance, but further conversation was prevented by the sound of a clear musical note that suddenly pierced the air from outside.</P>

<P>I turned towards the sound, a new surge of hope rising in my breast.  &quot;That is no orc horn!&quot; I told the others before running up the stairs and out into the night air, Aragorn close behind.</P>

<P>We raced out to the battlements and the sight that met our eyes stopped me in my tracks.  A whole regiment of elves stood in the moonlight, their leader in front of them, greeting the king.  It was Haldir, in sparkling silver armour and a sumptuous red cloak, the inner light of his spirit shining almost as brightly to my eyes as the polished metal of his breastplate.  Memories of the night we spent together in Lothlorien flooded my mind; once again he had arrived unexpectedly at a time of great need, but this time he would be aiding an entire nation and not just me.</P>

<P>Aragorn flew down the steps in front of me, skidding to a halt at the bottom.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Well met, Haldir!&quot; </I>he said in Elvish, then continued in Common, &quot;You are most welcome!&quot;</P>

<P>They both placed their hands on their hearts in the traditional elven greeting, but then Aragorn broke his reserve and pulled Haldir into an exuberant hug.  Haldir started in surprise, catching my eye and raising a sardonic eyebrow.</P>

<P>&quot;We are proud to fight alongside men once more,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>It made my heart lighter just to look upon him and I moved down to offer my own greeting.  Aragorn’s impulsive action had set the standard so I took the opportunity to enclose Haldir in an embrace of my own.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>I cannot tell you how glad I am that you are here,&quot; </I>I murmured in Elvish as he held me in his arms once again, his warmth and light reminding me of all the beauty and peace that existed outside the dark and angry world of men.</P>

<I><P>&quot;I will always be there for you when you are in need,&quot;</I> came his soft reply, sending a rush of mixed joy and confusion through me.</P>

<P>There was no more time for words.  The alarm was sounded and everyone scrambled to take their places on the battlements.  Haldir and his warriors had arrived just in time and, looking out over the dark hordes of Saruman’s army as they approached the keep, I knew we would need every single one of their swords and bows if we were to prevail.</P>

<P>I stationed myself at the centre of the wall, in amongst the other elves, with Gimli at my side.  The top of Gimli’s helmet was level with the top of the wall and he grumbled, &quot;You could have picked a better spot.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn came up to us, looking every inch the military commander in expression and bearing, and I saw an inkling of the king he was born to be.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let’s hope it lasts the night,&quot; Gimli said.</P>

<P>I took the chance to reinforce my earlier words of renewed support.  &quot;Your friends are with you, Aragorn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let’s hope they last the night,&quot; came Gimli’s wry comment.</P>

<P>Aragorn said nothing, but he patted me on the shoulder as he moved off again.</P>

<P>A crash of thunder split the night and it suddenly began to rain heavily.  No-one reacted to the change in the weather, getting wet being the least of our worries in that moment.  Along the wall, Aragorn addressed the elven contingent, impressing the ruthlessness of our foe upon them.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Show them no mercy, for you shall receive none!&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>The approaching army stopped some distance from the wall, and we waited in a moment of tension-filled silence, the calm before the storm of battle.  The enemy gave a great cry, bellowing their menace across the distance between us, but still they did not advance.</P>

<P>&quot;What’s happening out there?&quot; Gimli demanded impatiently, unable to see a thing.</P>

<P>Seeing the Uruk-hai lined up against us emphasised how desperate our situation was, but the arrival of Haldir and the elves had lifted my spirits and given me hope.  The despair of earlier had been entirely dispelled and I found a grim desire to have at our foes rising in my breast.  I smiled down at Gimli.</P>

<P>&quot;Shall I describe it to you?  Or would you like me to find you a box?&quot;</P>

<P>He looked up at me in surprise for a moment and then burst out laughing.</P>

<P>Out on the plain, the Uruk-hai began beating the ground with their spears, trying to intimidate us before the attack.  In response, Aragorn drew his sword with the clean sound of metal against metal and, all around me, archers put arrows to their bows.  There was a long moment of charged suspense, then a single arrow suddenly flew from the ranks of the defenders to embed itself in the neck of one of the foremost Uruk-hai.</P>

<P>Aragorn called for us to hold as we watched the orc slowly topple forwards to land face-first in the mud with a clatter of armour.  The enemy roared in anger, finally prompted to action, and made their charge.</P>

<P>And so it began.</P>

<P>The battle was long and bloody.  The Uruk-hai just kept on coming, their numbers never seeming to lessen, their strength never seeming to waver.  Men died in their tens and hundreds all around me and it was all I could do to keep my feet on the slippery stone as I fought for my life.  I started out at Gimli’s side, the dwarf’s terrible joy in the fight lending me the strength I needed to slaughter our foes as they climbed the walls.  We began a contest, keeping count of the number we had killed, in some way stepping back from the horror of the situation and objectifying our actions, as well as encouraging each other to greater effort.</P>

<P>It was impossible for me to keep track of my friends throughout the course of the battle and, when Theoden finally sounded the retreat, I was relieved to meet both Aragorn and Gimli inside the keep.  I immediately joined the group shoring up the inner door, but kept part of my attention on the argument brewing between Aragorn and Theoden at the other end of the hall at the same time.</P>

<P>Theoden’s defeatist attitude was once more at the fore.  He stood apart from the rest of us, making no move to help in the continuing defence.</P>

<P>&quot;The fortress is taken,&quot; he said.  &quot;It is over.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn’s frustration burst forth.  &quot;You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.  They still defend it.  They have died defending it!&quot;</P>

<P>The sounds of the enemy reached our ears from outside the door, death approaching on armoured feet.</P>

<P>&quot;Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?&quot; Aragorn asked.</P>

<P>Theoden made no answer.</P>

<P>&quot;Is there no other way?&quot; Aragorn repeated insistently.</P>

<P>It was one of the Rohirrim who finally replied.  &quot;There is one passage.  It leads into the mountains.  But they will not get far.  The Uruk-hai are too many.&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn took charge in that moment, bypassing the dazed and non-responsive king.  &quot;Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass,&quot; he ordered.  &quot;And barricade the entrance!&quot;  He was effectively giving the order to trap us in the keep, but I knew there were none there would begrudge giving up their lives in order to provide the women and children even the smallest hope of escape.</P>

<P>&quot;So much death,&quot; Theoden murmured, his focus drifting in his despair.  &quot;What can men do against such reckless hate?&quot;</P>

<P>Aragorn’s reply was firm.  &quot;Ride out with me.  Ride out and meet them.&quot;</P>

<P>His determination and charisma finally had an effect.  Theoden turned to face him, his expression set.</P>

<P>&quot;For death and glory,&quot; the king said.</P>

<P>&quot;For Rohan,&quot; Aragorn encouraged, reminding Theoden of his responsibilities.  &quot;For your people.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The sun is rising,&quot; Gimli pointed out and, indeed, the first rays of daylight were beginning to spill through the window, promising hope of a new day.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes.  Yes!&quot;  Theoden was becoming more animated, caught up in the idea of dying in a blaze of glory rather than allowing the enemy simply to overrun his keep.  &quot;The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.&quot;  Theoden addressed Aragorn.  &quot;Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.&quot;</P>

<P>Gimli was despatched to sound the horn, while the rest of us mounted up on our horses and prepared to take the battle to the enemy once again.  Theoden positioned himself at the head of the column.</P>

<P>&quot;Fell deeds awake,&quot; he intoned.  &quot;Now for wrath.  Now for ruin.  And the red dawn!&quot;</P>

<P>When the orcs broke down the door, we were ready for them and they were met by the unexpected sight of mounted warriors ready to confront them.</P>

<P>&quot;Forth Eorlingas!&quot; Theoden cried and led the charge.</P>

<P>We galloped through the stone corridors and out onto the causeway, trampling and cutting down the Uruk-hai on every side as we went.  The light of the dawn brought new strength to weary limbs and the surprise of our attack worked to our advantage.  We were still hopelessly outnumbered, though, and I prepared myself to die in the defence of Helm’s Deep.</P>

<P>But a shout from Aragorn changed everything.  He directed my attention to where Gandalf and the banished Rohirrim had appeared at the top of a hill to one side, and suddenly defeat was no longer inevitable.  The reinforcements joined the fray in a blaze of bright light, Gandalf at their head on the Mearas Shadowfax.</P>

<P>The enemy were quickly routed and began to flee the field; we chased them over the ridge, victory cries resounding throughout our ranks.  We were brought up short by the unexpected sight of a forest that had seemingly appeared from nowhere during the night.  Eomer galloped across in front of us, warning us to stay out of the trees and we watched as the surviving orcs ran beneath their cover.  Moments later, there was a great groaning and rustling, followed by the screams of dying Uruk-hai.  There was the answer to Gimli’s question of how Merry and Pippin had fared in Fangorn; the trees had marched into battle and taken revenge on those who had destroyed so many of their fellows.</P>

<P>The remaining warriors of Rohan, with Aragorn and Gandalf among them, made their way back to the keep.  I remained on the battlefield outside the walls, spotting Gimli sitting on the body of an orc and wandering over to join him.</P>

<P>I stroked my hand along my bow and announced with satisfaction, &quot;Final count – forty-two.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Forty-two?&quot; he repeated.  &quot;Oh, that’s not bad for a pointy-eared elvish princeling.&quot;  His expression turned smug.  &quot;I myself am sitting pretty on forty-three.&quot;</P>

<P>I wasn’t about to let him get away with a patronising triumph.  I drew my bow in a flash and fired an arrow into the body of the orc, aiming it directly in between Gimli’s legs.  To his credit, he barely flinched.</P>

<P>&quot;Forty-three,&quot; I said with a grin.</P>

<P>Gimli protested, &quot;He was already dead.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He was twitching,&quot; I countered.</P>

<P>I got the desired reaction as he lost his temper and cried, &quot;He was twitching because he’s got my axe embedded in his nervous system!&quot;  He jerked the weapon, causing the orc’s limbs to jump.</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; I said nonchalantly, &quot;I’ll wager I know someone who will have beaten both our scores put together.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who?  Aragorn?&quot; Gimli asked.</P>

<P>&quot;No, Haldir,&quot; I replied.  &quot;He’s better with both bow and sword than I am, and he’s had far more battle experience, too.  Let’s head back to the keep and find out if he was keeping score.&quot;</P>

<P>I offered Gimli a hand and pulled him to his feet.  </P>

<P>We walked back up the causeway together, but what we saw when we arrived at the gates destroyed all the pleasure I took in our victory.  Aragorn was standing just inside with Eowyn, their expressions sorrowful and, coming towards us, was a long column of elves, the frontmost pairs carrying stretchers between them.  On the first pallet, I caught a glimpse of scarlet and silver and my heart missed a beat as the meaning of what I saw struck at it with knives of grief.</P>

<P>The elves paid me no heed, marching past and out through the gates without a word, their obligations fulfilled and their feet turning back towards Lothlorien and Rivendell where they could mourn their losses away from the prying eyes of men.  As the last of them stepped onto the causeway, I collapsed to my knees in their wake and, for the first time in my seventy-nine years, I wept.  Haldir was dead.</P>

<P>I sensed my two friends approaching to stand behind me, but I could not turn to look at them.  All I could think about was the elvish blood that had been spilled in the night.  Haldir, one of the best of my race, would grace the woods of Lothlorien with his luminous spirit no more.  I felt as if my heart had been torn in two, guilt at my inability to return his feelings for me mingling with horror at the violent ending of an immortal life.  There was a rustle of skirts and suddenly warm arms wrapped around me and pulled me into a tight embrace.  Eowyn, her curtain of hair enfolding us both, held me as I wept, rocking me like a child, until my tears were spent.  I accepted her silent comfort without shame and, when I had gained control of myself once more, she walked beside me as we made our way back into the city.</P>

<P>*  *  *</P>

<P>As the clearing of the battlefield went on and preparations for the burial of the fallen men of Rohan were made, Gandalf called us together and told us it was time for us to leave.</P>

<P>&quot;We must to Isengard,&quot; he said, &quot;to determine the fate of Saruman.&quot;</P>

<P>Theoden, his aide Gamling, and Eomer rode with us.  We paused at the top of the ridge and looked to the east, where the red sky over Mordor still stained the horizon and thunder rumbled in the distance, reminding us that the greatest threat still existed.</P>

<P>&quot;Sauron’s wrath will be terrible,&quot; Gandalf warned, &quot;his retribution swift.  The battle of Helm’s Deep is over.  The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.  All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits, somewhere in the wilderness.&quot;</P>

<P>All I could hope was that Sam and Frodo yet lived and would be able to succeed in the monumental task they had been set, so that all our suffering and sacrifice would not have been in vain.</P>
