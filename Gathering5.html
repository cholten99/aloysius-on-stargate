	<td colspan=4 rowspan=1 width=566><span style="font-size:14">Now we are in the Viper camp, attending a meeting with some were-bears from the north.&nbsp; They have information for us, concerning Rus.&nbsp; The Tartar War is long over and all of the Great Forest is cast into winter.&nbsp; The Vipers have routed the Tartars and driven them south.&nbsp; The Cathayans remain in Muscovi.&nbsp; We are not certain if the Tsar is operating under free will or is being controlled.&nbsp; The Princess has come seeking out allies to help us restore Rus to its former glory.&nbsp; The Princess said the Tsar had a lucid moment before she left Rus, telling her that the Cathayans were controlling him and he feared she would be assassinated should she try to interfere.&nbsp; This is why she left.&nbsp; The Cathayan advisor the Tsar sent to her is under close watch.<br><br>The Serbian mercenary company that have sought refuge with the Vipers have said they will fight for the Princess should they be needed.&nbsp; Alexi has informed the Vipers that the court in Rus have been kept entirely in the dark.&nbsp; We were not even aware the war had ended.&nbsp; If we are to free our country, we will need help from the outside.&nbsp; We also need to find out who within the court and amongst the four families can be trusted and who is not under the control of the Cathayans.&nbsp; A suggestion has been made that we should apply to the Healers' Guild for someone to accompany myself and Alexi back to Rus who could identify those who are under Cathayan control and possibly release them.<br><br>Dr Fairfax points out that the common people are th key.&nbsp; They need to be rallied to support the Princess.&nbsp; The Vipers have been at war for many years and will not have men spare to aid us.&nbsp; The Hirokahn (the were-bears) are of the opinion that the unnatural winter is our first concern - if we can alleviate this, it could bring the people to our cause, as they are suffering.&nbsp; The Great Forest has spread and needs to be brought back under control.&nbsp; Apparently, the Cathayans are being aided by the Scaven, and are erecting obelisks that destroy the forest surrounding them.&nbsp; Our ancestor spirit, Babba Yaga, is in control of the winter and we cannot blame her for trying to protect the forest from those who would destroy it.&nbsp; However, it is an increasing problem for the people.<br><br>Babba Yaga was killed in the war with the Tartars and legend says that the arrival of her replacement will bring 100 years of winter across the forest.&nbsp; The boundary stones need to be reset so that the forest will retreat to it original size and release our country from the winter.&nbsp; The covens will no doubt object to the diminishment of Babba Yaga's domain, but something must be done and the consequences will be dealt with.<br><br>The Hirokahn have volunteered to take on the problem of the winter and the Princess has offered our aid should they need it.&nbsp; There is tell of a ritual which can be performed at the Heartwood of Babba Yaga, whereby an embodiment of the unnatural winter can be raised and killed to alleviate the winter for one year.&nbsp; This is not a permanent solution but may be a useful stopgap to aid us in the short term.<br><br>Dr Fairfax raises an interesting point that the winter may be affected if we could get the people to worship the ancestor in her form of maid only, so that her power of spring comes to the fore.<br><br>Alexi says we need to combine the people's revolt with a political attack to solve the problem of the Tsar, since otherwise we risk civil war.<br><br>The Vipers tell us that the fey at the edge of the Great Forest may also help us if they are asked.&nbsp; It seems we have a great number of resources at our disposal.&nbsp; All we need to do now is organise and deploy them.<br><br>The High Incantor of the Vipers has arrived to help us determine how we can move the Sentinel stones to contain the forest.&nbsp; He is not very co-operative.&nbsp; He does not seem to understand the plight of the people.&nbsp; He think we need to solve the unnatural winter first and say that he will help us move the Sentinel stones if we can prevent the eternal winter.&nbsp; He seems concerned about the disappearance of some wolves and some mice in the forest - I do not understand this.<br><br>There are also patterns who were dedicated to Babba Yaga, which were freed upon her death.&nbsp; The new Ancestor is apparently a spirit from a different forest nearby, who cannot control anything as well.&nbsp; There is also talk of princes kissing the Winter Queen (one of whome may be her Serene Highness' brother, who disappeared some time ago) to awake her.&nbsp; This is all very confusing and I fear my account is losing coherency.&nbsp; There seems to be much uncertainty even amongst those who claim to know the situation.&nbsp; This mess of a situation is going to take a great deal of effort and unit to resolve and I feel more and more out of my depth, the more I hear.<br><br>The Hirokahn say they can remove the winter.&nbsp; The Viper incantor says the new Ancestor need the blood of our enemies to gain power.&nbsp; If this is where our worship is to lead, I am concerned for the fate of the people.&nbsp; If we are to turn into those who deal in blood magic, I think I would prefer to succumb to the winter.<br><br>*<br><br>We retired to the Princess' tent - myself, Alexi, Dr Fairfax and the Princess - to discuss the situation further.&nbsp; Many suggestions were put forward but no decisions were made.&nbsp; I believe there will be much more talk before there is any action, and it seems Alexi and I must prolong our stay.</span></td>
