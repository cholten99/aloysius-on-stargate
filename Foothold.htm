<P>General Hammond’s clenched fists ought to be the first sign that something isn’t quite right – but then I haven’t really paid attention to how he normally holds his hands when he’s standing at the foot of the ramp, so maybe I’m just trying too hard to look for clues.</P>

<P>The rain ponchos are pretty cool, though Jack obviously doesn’t rate their effectiveness very highly.</P>

<P>Daniel’s in speed-talking mode – he knows Jack’s not happy about the delay on the wet planet, and he’s obviously not too comfortable taking the blame for it when they didn’t actually find anything constructive.</P>

<P>Jack’s blocked ears act is funny, but it seems incongruous for him to be completely oblivious when the other three are showing varying degrees of concern and suspicion.</P>

<P>We get evidence of Jack’s dislike of needles – something which crops up in fanfic quite a lot – though it’s interesting that it’s Janet who usually gets all the flak for the injections in stories, when it’s actually a random nurse who does it in the episode.</P>

<P>Then, shock horror – Janet’s been compromised!  She’s knocking them out one by one – what could be going on???</P>

<P>Hammond, Fraiser and Siler make an interesting grouping for Teal’c to overhear the alien plot.  The undisguised aliens in the background almost go unnoticed in the face of familiar characters acting strangely.</P>

<P>Once again, we have Teal’c and Sam messing up the baddies’ plans by being physiologically awkward because of their symbiote contact.  It’s a very useful little plot device to have hanging around, and it makes for a good pairing when the team gets split.</P>

<P>I love the way Siler climbs onto the gurney to make it easier for Teal’c to move him after he’s knocked him out.  He makes for a very accommodating victim!</P>

<P>Teal’c starts his Die Hard impression, though he’s aided by having access to the armoury and being able to get help quickly by rescuing Sam.  They’re very touchy-feely in the elevator with Teal’c understandably putting his arms around her when she falls, but then also putting his hands on her thighs, to which she responds by squeezing his forearm.  It’s a familiarity I haven’t noticed before, but it shows how comfortable they now are with one another.</P>

<P>The bond is further demonstrated when they split up.  They’re both very practical about the necessity of Teal’c staying behind to buy Sam time, but you can tell she’s not keen on the idea and his absolute faith in her coming back is very sweet.</P>

<P>Teal’c’s pretty impressive – he manages to take out five guys with very little effort and barely even flinches when he gets shot.  It’s a good job the alien has really bad aim, though I guess it’s believable since he’s using an unfamiliar weapon.  The aliens aren’t *too* slow – it only takes them three confrontations to decide the best way to get Teal’c is to trap him in the corridors and gas him.</P>

<P>Surely, in the whole of the military, there must be *someone* better for Sam to call than Maybourne!  She couldn’t possibly expect him to help her without either screwing up or screwing her over.</P>

<P>The aliens’ cover story to convince Teal’c he’s been hallucinating is a very good one.  Of course, it helps that they have the appearance and memories of the SGC personnel, but it still shows a certain amount of resourcefulness and intelligence.</P>

<P>Jack and Daniel both look pretty good out of uniform in this episode, and the shades are a nice touch to make them look cool but also slightly distant.</P>

<P>The irony of the Jack impersonator saying that Sam isn’t exactly herself is great.  Their patter to Sam is very persuasive, too – getting her to list the side effects of the gas herself is very effective and then making her feel guilty about Teal’c is very cunning.</P>

<P>Daniel’s little concerned and sincere frown would just about persuade me of anything all on its own!  And I love the way Jack keeps shouting Maybourne down.</P>

<P>Sam’s still on top form even after she agrees to go back.  She doesn’t drink the orange juice Daniel gives her and she identifies the nearest gun in case of emergency.  Her training is very good and she doesn’t switch it off.  It’s rather fun watching her kill Jack, too!</P>

<P>The Daniel impersonator is a pretty good actor, and pretending surprise at Jack being an alien is a good tactic.</P>

<P>Then we get the slightly nervous entrance of Major Davis onto the scene – always a welcome addition to any episode if you ask me, though it’s not long before he’s emitting an alien scream and being blown away, too.</P>

<P>The weird gooey harnesses the victims are hanging in are rather cool – it’s certainly an innovative set-up.</P>

<P>Having Davis working with Jack makes an interesting change, too – he’s pretty quick on the uptake and not averse to a little action.  This is a situation we’ve not seen him in before, and it adds a lot of depth to his character.</P>

<P>This is a great episode for seeing the major characters killing each other and beating each other up – all good fun!  Sam pretending to be Daniel is cool, too.</P>

<P>I love the way Jack and Davis both leap backwards when Fraiser turns into an alien – it’s not as if they weren’t expecting it.  Jack pulled the device off her, after all!</P>

<P>MS does a great Sam impression – the ‘Colonel’ and ‘sir’ to Jack are fairly obvious, but the high speed theorising is just as characteristic of Sam as Daniel.  They really are very alike.</P>

<P>Jack springing Teal’c is classic Jack goofiness in the face of having to deceive the enemy.</P>

<P>The way the Hammond impersonator just leaves Sam to finish implementing her plan is just a tad idiotic, don’t you think?</P>

<P>It sounds like a pretty rousing speech the lead alien gives before he explodes – shame we can’t understand a word he says!</P>

<P>Maybourne is actually pretty impressive when he leads his men to secure the base, so it’s nice that Jack and Hammond both express their appreciation in the post-climax debrief.  And it’s even better that Maybourne passes the credit on to Sam – it seems Maybourne does have it in him to be a human being after all.  I think this probably signals his transition into a more ambiguous bad guy in Season Four.</P>

<P>All in all, a very cool episode.  No stand-out moments, but good solid fare with the alien impersonators making for an interesting scenario.</P>

<B><P>Characteristic Moments</P>

</B><P>Daniel gets snippy with Jack’s malapropism:</P>
<P>Jack: Even if we do find this Narcissus child…</P>
<P>Daniel: Harcesis!</P>

<P>Sam just lets it slide in the face of greater stresses:</P>
<P>Jack: Alright, exactly what are the side effects of this tetrachlora-ethel-mermalene stuff?</P>

<P>The alien mind link is deep enough to pick up catchphrases, though he does sound slightly unconvincing:</P>
<P>Jack: For crying out loud, Maybourne – cut her some slack.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Best Bits</P>

<P>The situation gets the better of Sam’s professionalism:</P>
<P>Sam: Maybourne, you are an idiot every day of the week!  Why couldn’t you have just taken one day off?</P>

<P>Jack belts the Fraiser impersonator:</P>
<P>Jack: That was weird…</P>
