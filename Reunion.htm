<P>There he stands, his robes tattered, the once smooth, glossy hair now limp and bedraggled.  The sparkling eyes and cocksure grin I remember have been replaced by a face lined with age and exhaustion, pain and anguish.  Can the beautiful man I once loved still be in there somewhere?  He used to be surrounded by admirers, now he stands alone – bereft of one friend, betrayed by a second, abandoned by the third, who now hesitates before him, wondering if forgiveness can ever be given.  The last twelve years have been difficult for me, but they must have been infinitely worse for him, imprisoned in that dreadful place.  Can he ever recover from what he suffered there, and can I ever make up for the fact that I left him there to rot?</P>

<P>Then I realise – he has no use for my guilt, no desire for my pity.  He needs someone – anyone – and I am the only one here.  Indecision over, I take three steps towards him and throw my arms around his too-thin frame, clutching him tightly.  He freezes for a moment and then hugs me back, trembling with suppressed emotion.  And we stand there, locked together, allowing the past to drift away in the hope that something better will be forged from our reunion.</P>

<P>THE END</P></FONT></BODY>
