<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">				Philip Larkin</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ed watched his targets
from behind a pillar.  The man and woman were sitting together at a
table in a crowded restaurant, evidently enjoying what would be their
last meal.  Ed took a moment to look at them, sitting there,
oblivious to his intentions, just as they had always been oblivious
to his needs.  The man was laughing, the smug, self-satisfied smile
on his face causing Ed&rsquo;s fingers to tighten unconsciously on
the barrel of the gun he held beneath his coat.  That smile had never
been far away, brought to bear as a hollow attempt to show attendance
to what Ed might be saying, feigning interest while in fact its owner
was only ever thinking about himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The woman was no
better.  Her innocent, well-intentioned exterior hid a cruel and
bitter heart, one that could stab and maim with a simple,
honey-coated sentence.  She would claim to be horrified if told what
effect her words had, but Ed knew that secretly she planned every
wound, crafting her thoughts to inflict the most damage possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There they were, the
two people who had hurt Ed most in the world.  Just looking at them
brought back the memories of a thousand broken promises, an endless
litany of small injuries that had slowly built up to leave him broken
and bleeding at their hands.  But no more.  This was the day that Ed
would free himself from the pain.  This was the day that Ed would
kill his parents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There were people all
around, but it didn&rsquo;t matter.  Nobody would stop Ed, and there
would be no recriminations afterwards.  Patricide and matricide had
been legalised some years before, when the government decided that
allowing a person to kill their parents would eradicate a large
proportion of the anger-induced violence in society.  Research showed
that most emotional problems stemmed from pent-up resentment against
parents, so a law was passed, giving each person the right to murder
their parents once they reached the age of twenty-one, as long as
they did it themselves and nobody else was hurt in the process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ed knew several people
who had done it already, and the way they spoke of the experience &ndash;
the blessed release, the sense of ultimate independence and
long-awaited freedom &ndash; well, apparently you couldn&rsquo;t
imagine it until you&rsquo;d done it for yourself.  Now was his
chance to find out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He stepped out from
behind the pillar, walked right up to the table and pulled his gun
out from beneath his coat.  His mother gasped, his father half rose
from his seat but sat down again as the barrel of the gun was trained
on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; his
father said, his voice trembling, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we talk about
this?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ed
replied firmly.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more of your
talk.  You know why I&rsquo;m here, and there&rsquo;s nothing left to
say.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With that, he pulled
the trigger, watching with satisfaction as the bullet passed through
his father&rsquo;s brain and blew the back of his head off.  His
father slumped onto the table.  His mother screamed, but the noise
was abruptly cut off by the sound of the gun firing again, and she
joined her husband, face first on the tablecloth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ed slipped the gun back
underneath his coat, spun on his heel and strode out of the
restaurant, feeling lighter and happier than he could ever remember.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As he left, a man on a
nearby table turned to his wife and said, &ldquo;Now, aren&rsquo;t
you glad we never had children?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">THE END</P>
