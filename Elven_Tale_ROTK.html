<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3><U>An Elven
Tale: The Return Of The King</U></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Six horses set out from
Helm&rsquo;s Deep on the morning of the victory against Saruman&rsquo;s
army, travelling a different road to the train of people setting out
after them.  The people pointed their footsteps towards Edoras and
home, while the horses made for Isengard, and perhaps further danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Theoden-King, with his
aide Gamling and his nephew Eomer, rode to determine the fate of his
enemy, accompanied by a wizard, a ranger, a dwarf, and myself, an
elf, all of whom had already travelled far in the pursuit of victory.
 A battle had been won but, as Gandalf had pointed out, the war was
far from over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Arod still gamely
carried both myself and Gimli, covering the ground with long strides,
apparently untroubled by his double burden.  We made good speed, but
even horses of Rohan cannot gallop indefinitely and we were forced to
a walking pace at times to preserve their strength.  It was during
one of these rest periods that Gimli broke the silence between us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I am sorry for
your loss, Legolas,&rdquo; he said, his voice gruff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I was glad I had my
back to him as the pain of Haldir&rsquo;s death washed over me anew. 
I sighed, trying to find some balance in the murky waters of my
grief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Haldir knew
centuries of peace and freedom,&rdquo; I replied.  &ldquo;He gave his
life so that others would have the chance to experience the same.  I
do not believe he would begrudge them his sacrifice.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And what about
you?&rdquo; Gimli persisted.  &ldquo;How are you holding up?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;He was my friend
&ndash; and sometimes more than that.&rdquo;  My gaze was drawn
involuntarily towards Aragorn, riding ahead of us.  &ldquo;But I
could not give him what he wanted of me, and for that I am sorry.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We lapsed into silence
again, and I was grateful that Gimli let the subject drop, though I
was also warmed by his concern.  I would have time to grieve for
Haldir properly later, when all this was over.  I only hoped that no
more of my friends would be added to those I would mourn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was a sombre
procession that walked beneath the trees of Fangorn shortly after the
sun had reached its zenith.  I think all of us were affected by the
atmosphere of the forest.  Mist swirled around the horses&rsquo; feet
as they picked their way between the gnarled trunks, finding a
twisting path among boulders and shrubs.  I felt the power of the
trees as a more immediate force now; they had awoken and taken a
stand against the rising evil.  We were certainly being watched and
appraised, but evidently our purpose was accepted as we were not
impeded in any way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was as we left the
forest that the unexpected sound of laughter reached my ears from up
ahead.  We came out onto a flooded plain with the Tower of Orthanc
rising up at its centre and the surrounded wall shattered and ruined.
 There, atop the wall, as if they had nary a care in the world, sat
two figures who brought a glimmer of joy to my darkened heart.  Merry
and Pippin grinned down at us as we all brought our horses to a halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry pushed himself,
somewhat unsteadily, to his feet, gestured at the tower behind him,
and cried, &ldquo;Welcome, my lords &ndash; to Isengard!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At my back, Gimli
harrumphed.  &ldquo;You young rascals!&rdquo; he called back, though
I could tell he was just as delighted as I to see the hobbits alive
and well.  &ldquo;A merry hunt you&rsquo;ve led us on &ndash; and now
we find you feasting and &ndash; and smoking!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For indeed, the two
hobbits had laid out a veritable picnic atop the wall; both had lit
pipes and were clutching tankards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn twisted in his
saddle and looked back at me with a broad grin, and I could not help
returning it.  It seemed that no matter what happened, hobbits would
always survive to celebrate afterwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin responded to
Gimli, his words more than a little slurred.  &ldquo;We are sitting
on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts.&rdquo; 
He took a bite of his sandwich and continued to speak around the
mouthful.  &ldquo;The salted pork is particularly good.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Salted pork?&rdquo;
Gimli spluttered in combined astonishment and envy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf muttered,
&ldquo;Hobbits,&rdquo; under his breath, but I could see he was
suppressing a grin of his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry gesticulated with
his pipe, clearly very pleased with himself.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
under orders from Treebeard, who&rsquo;s taken over management of
Isengard.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It seemed that we
needn&rsquo;t have worried about what Saruman might be up to; the
Ents and the hobbits had done a fine job of demolishing his power
base, as Merry and Pippin took delight in telling us.  Aragorn swung
Pippin up behind him, while Merry took up position behind Eomer and
we made our way to the base of the tower, the two hobbits regaling us
with the remarkable tale of the siege of Isengard.  Once again, the
small folk had surpassed expectations and achieved something
astonishing; I resolved never again to be surprised at their
exploits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The horses picked their
way carefully through the debris and fetlock-deep water.  There were
huge treelike creatures I knew well to be Ents moving around the
area, and one approached us as we reached the tower.  I took him to
be Treebeard, the Ent the hobbits had mentioned earlier, and he
addressed us in a deep and breathy voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Young Master
Gandalf,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
 The fact that he referred to Gandalf as &ldquo;young&rdquo; was not
wasted on me; I was already aware how ancient the Ents were.  &ldquo;Wood
and water, stock and stone, I can master.  But there&rsquo;s a wizard
to manage here&hellip; locked in his tower.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Show yourself.&rdquo;
 Aragorn spoke softly, evidently directing his words at Saruman,
though I was not sure how he expected the wizard to hear him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo;
Gandalf warned.  &ldquo;Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli spoke up, in his
usual manner.  &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just have his head and be
done with it.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
Gandalf replied.  &ldquo;We need him alive.&rdquo;  He elaborated, at
a grim look from Eomer.  &ldquo;We need him to talk.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As if summoned by our
discussion of him (and perhaps this was actually the case), a voice
echoed down from above.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;You have fought
many wars and slain many men, Theoden-King, and made peace
afterwards.&rdquo;  I looked up to see an old man in a white robe
stepping forwards to the edge of the platform atop the tower.  His
tone was reasonable, his words placatory.  &ldquo;Can we not take
counsel together as we once did, my old friend?&rdquo;  He leaned on
a slim, black staff, looking frail and weary.  &ldquo;Can we not have
peace, you and I?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;We shall have
peace,&rdquo; Theoden called back.  Aragorn looked across at him in
surprise, but then the king continued, his tone growing more angry
with every word.  &ldquo;We shall have peace when you answer for the
burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there!  We
shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers, whose bodies were
hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg, are
avenged!  When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows
&ndash; we shall have peace.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn turned his gaze
back up to Saruman.  I wondered if he shared my thoughts that such an
approach was unlikely to put Saruman into the right frame of mind to
give us information.  My fears were confirmed as the wizard responded
with contempt and anger of his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Gibbets and
crows?  Dotard!&rdquo;  He turned his attention to Gandalf, though he
did not attempt to wheedle his way into his fellow wizard&rsquo;s
good graces.  &ldquo;What do you want here, Gandalf Greyhame?  Let me
guess.  The key of Orthanc?  Or perhaps the keys to Barad-dur itself?
 Along with the crowns of the Seven Kings and the rods of the Five
Wizards!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf remained calm
in the face of this tirade, presumably trying to prevent the
conversation from descending into a pointless exchange of insults and
accusations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Your treachery
has cost many lives,&rdquo; he said, his words quiet, but still able
to carry to their recipient.  &ldquo;Thousands more are now at risk. 
But you could save them Saruman.  You were deep in the enemy&rsquo;s
counsel.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;So you have come
here for information,&rdquo; Saruman surmised.  &ldquo;I have some
for you.&rdquo;  He produced a large black sphere from within his
robes, its surface flecked with gold.  &ldquo;Something festers in
the heart of Middle Earth.  Something that you have failed to see.&rdquo;
 His tone shifted from contempt to awe.  &ldquo;But the Great Eye has
seen it.  Even now he presses his advantage.  His attack will come
soon.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf urged Shadowfax
closer to the base of the tower, as if this would somehow make
Saruman&rsquo;s meaning clearer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all
going to die,&rdquo; our enemy continued, presumably trying to
frighten us with his threats.  It seemed to be working on Merry, who
glanced around at us, his expression fearful.  &ldquo;But you know
this, don&rsquo;t you Gandalf?  You cannot think this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.  This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.  Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him, those he professes to love.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I wondered what Saruman
hoped to achieve in criticising Gandalf, who had ever been our
steadfast ally.  I reflected on our journey so far, and noted that
the only one Gandalf had thus far sacrificed had been himself, down
in the mines.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But the other wizard
had not yet finished.  &ldquo;Tell me, what words of comfort did you
give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom?&rdquo;  Gandalf
lowered his eyes at this, his expression pained, though I do not
believe any of the rest of us blamed him for Frodo&rsquo;s
involvement in our quest.  &ldquo;The path you have set him on can
only lead to death.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli reached the end
of his patience at this point.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough!&rdquo;
he declared.  He nudged me.  &ldquo;Shoot him.  Stick an arrow in his
gob.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I was not of a mind to
disagree with him, annoyed as I was at our enemy&rsquo;s attempt to
discourage us.  I reached over my shoulder to pull an arrow from my
quiver, but Gandalf halted my action with an outstretched hand and a
simple command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Come down,
Saruman,&rdquo; he called to his rival, &ldquo;and your life will be
spared.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This appeal fell on
completely deaf ears.  &ldquo;Save your pity and your mercy.  I have
no use for it!&rdquo; Saruman cried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With that, he raised
his staff above his head and a torrent of fire shot from the end of
it, streaming to the ground and completely engulfing both Gandalf and
Shadowfax.  All the other horses skittered backwards in alarm and we
were forced to raise our arms to shield our faces from the heat. 
Shock radiated from everyone in the group, but the flames quickly
receded to reveal wizard and horse untouched.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Completely unfazed by
the attack, Gandalf stated matter-of-factly, &ldquo;Saruman, your
staff is broken.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The other wizard looked
at the rod in his hand and it exploded into shards.  Saruman
staggered slightly and clutched his burned hand to his chest. 
Meanwhile, another figure appeared on the platform behind him.  It
was Wormtongue, his black clothes and hair making a marked contrast
to the entirely white attire of his master.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Theoden spotted him and
spoke.  &ldquo;Grima, you need not follow him.  You were not always
as you are now.  You were once a man of Rohan.  Come down.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With my keen eyes, I
saw Wormtongue bow slightly and mouth &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;, though
he did not speak aloud.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Given the state in
which we found Theoden at Edoras, and given Wormtongue's part in
that, I was impressed with Theoden's compassion.  I sensed that
Wormtongue desperately needed an authority figure to tell him what to
do, and that he realised Saruman's control over the situation was
failing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Unfortunately,
Saruman's grasp of things was not so perceptive.  He poured scorn on
the exchange.  &ldquo;A man of Rohan?  What is the house of Rohan but
a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll
on the floor with the dogs?  The victory at Helm&rsquo;s Deep does
not belong to you, Theoden Horse-Master.  You are a lesser son of
greater sires.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Making a visible effort
to ignore the barbs of the wizard, Theoden continued in his attempt
to bring Wormtongue round to our side.  &ldquo;Grima, come down.  Be
free of him.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Free?&rdquo;
Saruman spat.  &ldquo;He will never be free.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Wormtongue spoke for
the first time, simply saying, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I wasn't sure if he was
agreeing with Saruman's pronouncement, or if he was trying to defy
it, but he didn't get a chance to elaborate, since Saruman shouted,
&ldquo;Get down, you cur!&rdquo; and struck Grima, who fell to the
ground with a shocked cry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf completely
ignored the Wormtongue issue, repeating his previous statement,
presumably in an attempt to get the conversation back onto what he
considered a more important topic.  &ldquo;Saruman.  You were deep in
the enemy's counsel.  Tell us what  you know!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Saruman apparently
decided it was time to deal.  &ldquo;You withdraw your guard, and I
will tell you where your doom will be decided.  I will not be held
prisoner here.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I was certain that
Gandalf would not trust him but Wormtongue took matters into his own
hands.  He rose up, grabbed Saruman from behind and stabbed him twice
in the back with a knife he had evidently been concealing.  My arrow
was loosed as he moved, but it was too late to save Saruman. 
Wormtonge staggered backwards and fell, the shaft protruding from his
chest.  Saruman turned slowly, his expression radiating shock at what
his erstwhile servant had done to him, and toppled off the tower. 
His body spun as it fell, tracked by the eyes of everyone who waited
on the ground, and impaled itself on the spikes of a big water wheel
in front of us.  Merry and Pippin gasped in horror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf's words to
Theoden were urgent.  &ldquo;Send word to all our allies and to every
corner of Middle Earth that still stnads free.  The enemy moves
against us.  We need to know where he will strike.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As he stopped speaking,
the wheel groaned and began to move, slowly submerging Saruman's body
in the murky water.  Something slipped from the sleeve of his robes
as they shifted, but I couldn't tell what it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Treebeard spoke
reflectively, expressing the change in atmosphere that I, too, could
feel with the death of Saruman.  &ldquo;The filth of Saruman is
washing away.  Trees will come back to live here.  Young trees,&rdquo;
he added wistfully, as if envying them their chance to reclaim the
evil place for nature.  &ldquo;Wild trees.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Meanwhile, Pippin had
slipped unnoticed from the back of Aragorn's horse and was wading
through the water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Pippin!&rdquo;
Aragorn called, bringing everyone's attention to the errant hobbit's
actions.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin ignored him,
instead reaching down to where something gleamed beneath the surface
of the water, and lifting up a large, translucent sphere of what
looked like glass, with golden light intermittently piercing the
shadows within it.  It was a Palantir, one of the last seeing stones,
something I had heard about in my youth.  Pippin held it reverently
in his small hands, his gaze transfixed by the play of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Bless my bark!&rdquo;
Treebeard exclaimed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf, however, had
ridden up behind Pippin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Peregrine Took!&rdquo;
he said sharply, causing the young hobbit to start and look round
guiltily.  The wizard reached out a hand and said firmly, &ldquo;I'll
take that, my lad.&rdquo;  Pippin's gaze was drawn back to his prize,
but Gandalf continued, &ldquo;Quickly, now.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin handed over the
Palantir reluctantly and Gandalf covered it with a fold of his cloak,
uttering a grunt of displeasure and directing a sharp glare towards
the hobbit.  Pippin looked down at his feet, hurt and disappointment
clear on his face, his expression turning to resentment as Gandalf
turned Shadowfax away.  I didn't like to see how quickly an
instrument of Saruman's evil had affected little Pippin, and I was
glad Gandalf had acted so promptly to remove him from its influence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">* * *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our purpose at Orthanc
thwarted by Wormtongue's rash act, we left Treebeard to watch over
the site, and turned our horses towards Edoras.  The sense of urgency
that had led speed to our journey to Isengard remained with us as we
rode; the threat from Saruman was now over, but the over-riding
danger of Sauron hung over us yet.  I could tell that Theoden and
Eomer were eager to reach their home and see that their people were
safe, while the set of Gandalf's shoulders showed the tension of
Saruman's arrogant words.  The wizard would not rest until the whole
of Middle Earth was free.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, people cannot
maintain such emotion indefinitely, and the atmosphere as we entered
the walls of Edoras was one of celebration.  As far as those brave
people were concerned, a major battle had been won and their enemy
defeated, and they wanted to enjoy the respite from fear and violence
that their home afforded them.  Theoden gathered all the people who
would fit into his great hall but, before the celebration could
begin, he charged them not to forget those whose lives had been lost
the night before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Tonight we
remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.  Hail the
victorious dead!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The people echoed this
shout and everyone raised a glass to honour their missing countrymen.
 The wine in my own cup tasted bitter, as Theoden's words brought
back the memory of Haldir's death, which had been suppressed by my
relief and joy at being reunited with the hobbits.  I appreciated the
Rohan tradition of celebrating the sacrifice of those who fell in
battle, but I could not yet look upon the loss of Haldir in that
light, despite my earlier words to Gimli.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once this solemn
ceremony was over, musicians struck up their instruments and all the
people broke up into smaller groups, to enjoy the company of loved
ones who had survived, or to comfort each other in their grief for
those who had died.  I was at a loss as to what to do with myself, as
I had no-one with whom to share my loss, and I did not feel up to
being sociable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer arrived at my
side and solved my dilemma with an arm acrosss my shoulders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Come, friend,&rdquo;
he said.  &ldquo;You look like you could use a drink.  Let me show
you the hospitality of the Rohan.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I let myself be led
away to a table where Gimli was already seated beside a barrel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Ah, Legolas,
lad!&rdquo; he exclaimed on seeing me.  &ldquo;Try some of this ale
with me.  I'd wager you'll be lying under the table after one
tankard, and that's something I'd like to see!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At these words, a broad
grin spread across Eomer's features.  He spread his arms and
addressed the crowd.  &ldquo;You have all heard the challenge spoken!
 You will all witness the outcome, and see whether the elf can prove
the dwarf wrong!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There were hearty
cheers and I found a frothing tankard thrust into my hands, while
another was presented to Gimli.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer looked at us with
mock sternness.  &ldquo;No pauses.  No spills,&rdquo; he admonished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And no
regurgitation!&rdquo; Gimli added, much to the amusement of the
growing crowd around us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I looked at the drink I
was holding and then up at Eomer as it dawned on me what was
happening.  &ldquo;So, it's a drinking game.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli raised his glass
to me and confirmed, &ldquo;Last one standing wins.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Someone in the crowd
called out, &ldquo;What shall we drink to?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Answering shouts
reverberated around the room.  &ldquo;To victory!  To victory!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All the men around us
took a drink, and Gimli upended his tankard, guzzling down the ale
with abandon.  I was not sure this drinking game was a very good
idea, and I couldn't join in the hearty victory cheer, but I would
drink to Haldir and perhaps the Rohan ale would numb the pain that
still stabbed at my heart.  I took a cautious sniff of the drink and
then gulped it down.  It was rough, but not unpleasant, and I awaited
its affect but nothing happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I don't feel
anything,&rdquo; I said to Eomer in puzzlement, and he laughed
heartily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The dwarf has
already been proven wrong!&rdquo; he cried.  &ldquo;But the stakes
have changed now &ndash; you keep drinking until one of you can drink
no more.  Here &ndash; see if a second makes any difference.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Rohan warrior next
to the barrel kept passing out the drinks, and Gimli and I kept
drinking them but, while the taste began to get more pleasant, I
still didn't feel any different.  Gimli, on the other hand, slowly
got less and less comprehensible in the comments he made between
drinks, until he finally started making no sense at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On about our fifteenth
tankard, he spluttered a little, turned to me with an extremely
serious expression on his face, and said with some force, &ldquo;It's
the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I decided not to ask
him to explain himself, as I was quite certain I didn't want any more
details on that statement.  I exchanged a glance with Eomer, who was
looking at me with undisguised admiration on his face, evidently
because I was still standing up with ease, while Gimli was swaying in
his chair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Suddenly, though, a
strange sensation started spreading through my left hand, and I
brought it up to my face to look at it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I feel
something,&rdquo; I said with some surprise.  Eomer raised an
eyebrow.  &ldquo;A slight tingling in my fingers.  I think it's
affecting me.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At that, Gimli spoke up
again.  &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; he exclaimed in triumph.  &ldquo;He
can't hold his liquor.&rdquo;  At which point, the dwarf went
cross-eyed and toppled over backwards onto the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I smiled at Eomer with
a feeling of satisfaction that I had defeated Gimli, albeit in a
rather ridiculous contest, and Eomer declared, &ldquo;Game over.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Rohirrim
surrounding us all cheered and started slapping me on the back, which
nearly sent me to the floor as well, but I managed to keep my feet,
and took their congratulations with good humour.  However, the game
had not aided me the way I had hoped, and I still felt unwilling to
engage in the hearty camaraderie of these sturdy fold who were my
hosts.  I excused myself as soon as was polite, and left them to pick
up Gimli and deposit him somewhere out of the way.  I slipped out of
the hall, grabbed a cloak from my pack and found my way outside, away
from the noise, where I could examine my thoughts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I realised it was
stupid to seek forgetfulness in the bottom of a tankard.  That did no
honour to Haldir's memory, and would not achieve any peace in my
heart in the long run.  What I needed was some solitude, away from
revellers and concerned friends alike, where I could think about my
friend and come to terms with his loss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I found a raised
platform of paving stones, which looked out over Edoras, and sat down
to meditate.  I closed my eyes and brought a picture of Haldir to the
forefront of my mind.  He looked at me reproachfully and I whispered,
&ldquo;I'm sorry.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Images of the times I
had seen him and the occasions we had spent together flitted through
my mind.  He was a comfort and a companion, but nothing more to me. 
The ache in my heart had more to do with guilt than selfish pain at
separation.  I had possessed the means to make him happy and I had
kept it from him.  However, looking back over the years of our
friendship, I saw that even this was a misrepresentation of events, a
skewed version that placed far more importance on my place in his
life that I warranted.  He had many friends and lovers, a vital role
in the safeguarding of Lothlorien, many pursuits and skills, none of
which had anything to do with me.  His love for me was a casual thing
that had brightened both our lives when we had been together, but no
caused him any undue pain when we were apart..</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The picture of Haldir's
face shook his head slowly in amusement at my self-importance and
smiled at my realisation that his life had been full of so much more
than yearning for me.  Then, he turned from me, and faded away.  With
him went the black despair that had been growing deep inside me and,
at last, I felt peace.  I would miss him and think of him fondly, but
no longer would I torture myself over his lost happiness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I raised myself up off
the cold stone and turned my attention to more pressing matters.  The
red glow hanging over Mordor shifted and writhed in the distance,
like an amorphous creature awaiting its moment to strike.  The malice
emanating from that evil place pressed upon me, its weight attempting
to crush my spirit.  But I was determined that it would not succeed;
if grief for a friend could not defeat me, the machinations of an
arrogant would-be god certainly would not, either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As dawn approached,
spreading its promise of light and warmth across the open landscape
of Rohan, I heard a step on the paving stones behind me, and knew
that Aragorn had come to seek me out.  I did not want to speak of
what was in my heart, nor discuss anything that had happened to us or
between us in the last two days, so I pre-empted him and directed his
attention to the ugly view.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The stars are
veiled,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;Something stirs in the east.  A
sleepless malice.&rdquo;  We exchanged a glance, and I could tell he
knew that the melodrama of my words was masking subjects I did not
wish to raise.  He said nothing, respecting my desire for silence
between us, at least for the moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, the force of
Sauron's malice drove towards me in a violent spike, as if it was
suddenly drawn away from Mordor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The eye of the
enemy is moving,&rdquo; I told Aragorn, as the focus of that
attention fixed within the building behind us.  &ldquo;He is here.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We ran as one, Aragorn
presumably heading to where he knew the others were, while I followed
the pull of evil as if it were a string attached to my heart, leading
me to my destiny.  We burst in upon a scene of chaos.  Pippin was
writhing around on the floor, his hands seemingly clamped to the
Palantir, which was glowing brightly.  Merry knelt on the other side
of the room, his face stricken with fear and horror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn acted without
thought or consideration for his own safety, grabbing the evil device
from the hobbit.  His entire body convulsed on contact with it, and
he fell to his knees, his teeth gritted against its influence.  I
rushed to help him, clasping his shoulders and passing what energy I
had to fight it into him.  Whether by his own will, or through my
aid, Aragron managed to release the ball, slumping against my chest,
obviously thoroughly shaken by even such short contact with Sauron's
mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Roused by the
commotion, Gandalf chased the rolling Palantir across the floor of
the chamber and threw a blanket over it.  As if a lamp had been
extinguished, the awful pressure of our enemy's presence amongst us
was cut off, and I felt a darkness lift from my mind.  Aragorn had
slipped further to the floor, but now looked up into my concerned
eyes with a reassuring smile.  I helped him sit up, and he did not
move away from my hands, his body still trembling beneath my fingers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry rushed to his
friend's side, crying, &ldquo;Pippin!&rdquo; and bringing all our
attention back to the smallest of our party, who lay, unmoving, on
the stone floor, his eyes open and his face slack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf cursed, &ldquo;Fool
of a Took!&rdquo; echoing his words in the depths of Moria after
Pippin had knocked the orc skeleton down the well, bringing the
hordes down upon us in the mine.  This time, though, his voice held
more fear than anger, and I found myself fervently hoping the foolish
Took would survive this latest misadventure to bring disaster upon us
once again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The wizard hurried to
where the hobbits were, pushing poor Merry out of his way as he knelt
down and grabbed Pippin's small hand.  He laid his own over Pippin's
face and muttered something I could not make out.  His hand moved
across to rest on Pippin's cheek and, suddenly, Pippin came awake,
gasping as if he had run up ten flights of stairs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo;
the wizard commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin replied,
&ldquo;Gandalf, forgive me.&rdquo;  His voice was so small and
desperate that I knew the punishment he had already received far
outweighed the crime of stealing the Palantir.  He closed his eyes
and tried to turn his face away, but Gandalf pulled his gaze back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo;
he commanded again.  &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;A tree,&rdquo;
Pippin whispered, his eyes now wide and fearful.  &ldquo;There was a
white tree, in a courtyard of stone.  It was dead.  The city was
burning.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I felt Aragorn tense,
and Gandalf soon explained why.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Minas Tirith,&rdquo;
he interpreted.  &ldquo;Is that what you saw?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin continued, the
fear in his voice growing audibly with every word.  &ldquo;I saw &ndash;
I saw him.  I could hear his voice in my head.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And what did you
tell him?&rdquo;  Gandalf's words were harsh.  &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;He asked me my
name.  I didn't answer.  He hurt me.&rdquo;  Pippin's face screwed up
with remembered pain, but he kept his eyes fixed on Gandalf's.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What did you
tell him about Frodo and the Ring?&rdquo; the wizard demanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
Pippin protested.  &ldquo;Nothing, Gandalf.  I promise!&rdquo;  Tears
leaked out of the corners of his eyes and trickled slowly down his
pale face.  &ldquo;I'm sure I would have told him whatever he wanted
to know, though, if Aragorn hadn't taken the stone from me.  I'm
sorry!  I'm so sorry!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf rose to his
feet, ignoring the weeping hobbit, and turning his stern visage to
Aragorn.  &ldquo;We must raise King Theoden.  We now know where
Sauron will strike.  We must decide how to use this knowledge to our
advantage.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He crossed to where his
robes lay and put them on hurriedly, then swept from the room. 
Aragorn and I spared a glance for little Pippin, who still lay on the
floor with Merry's arms now around him, then followed Gandalf out
into the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*  *  *  *  *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">By the time we had
managed to find a servant to fetch the king, and had gathered
everyone in the hall of Meduseld, the morning sunlight was streaming
in through the high windows.  The difference in atmosphere from the
revelries of the night before was palpable.  My mind wandered
slightly as Gandalf recounted what had happened, and I found myself
hoping that last night would not be the last celebration to echo
around these walls.  Gandalf's next pronouncement brought me back to
the present proceedings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;There was no lie
in Pippin's eyes.  A fool, but an honest fool he remains.  He told
Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This elicited an
audible sigh of relief from Gimli, though I noticed Pippin dropping
his eyes to the floor shamefacedly on the other side of the room. 
His cousin stood staunchly by his side, though his face betrayed fear
and anger in equal measure at his young relative's actions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;We've been
strangely fortunate,&rdquo; Gandalf continued.  &ldquo;Pippin saw in
the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan.  Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.  His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy
one thing.  He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He paused to throw a
significant glance at Aragorn, who stood straighter under his gaze. 
I felt a shiver of foreboding that I did not want explained.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;There is courage
still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him,&rdquo; Gandalf went
on.  &ldquo;Sauron fears this.  He will not risk the peoples of
Middle Earth uniting under one banner.  He will raze Minas Tirith to
the ground before he sees a king return to the throne of men.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I was still watching
Aragorn and I saw the look of apprehension that crossed his face at
these words.  I knew he would not try to evade his duty, though I
also knew the throne of Gondor held no appeal for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf still continued
in his speech.  &ldquo;If the beacons of Minas Tirith are lit, Rohan
must be ready for war.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, it seemed his
words had had little effect on our current host.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo;
Theoden asked, &ldquo;why should we ride to the aid of those who did
not come to ours?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We all stared at him in
disbelief, unable to comprehend his attitude.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What do we owe
Gondor?&rdquo; he demanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn ignored him,
stating instead, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; 
Gandalf was firm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;They must be
warned,&rdquo; Aragorn persisted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;They will be,&rdquo;
Gandalf reassured him, then moved close to speak more quietly to
Aragorn.  &ldquo;You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. 
Follow the river.  Look to the black ships.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I did not know what he
meant, but the shiver of foreboding skittered down my spine again at
his words.  I vowed silently to myself and I would not let Aragorn
out of my sight along whatever path he might take.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I ride for Minas
Tirith,&rdquo; Gandalf stated firmly.  &ldquo;And I won't be going
alone.&rdquo;  He looked across at Pippin.  &ldquo;You, my lad, will
be coming with me.&rdquo;  He gave Pippin no time to react.  &ldquo;You've
already got your cloak on &ndash; good.  Come along quickly, now. 
We've a long way to go, and the daylight won't wait for us.&rdquo; 
With that, he strode from the hall, obviously expecting Pippin to
follow in his wake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin looked at Merry,
who shrugged his shoulders.  &ldquo;Don't look at me,&rdquo; he said,
irritably.  &ldquo;This is one mess I can't get you out of.  Come on,
we'd better go.&rdquo;  Merry took Pippin's arm and practically
dragged him from his seat, leading him after the wizard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">And that was the last I
saw of Pippin for quite some time.  After such a happy reunion, our
group had been sundered once more.  As I thought of Pippin being
separated from the last of his friends, my mind also turned to Sam
and Frodo, who were somewhere out in the wilderness, really alone and
with so much still resting on them.  I hoped they were faring well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli, Aragorn, Merry
and I settled into an uneasy existence at Edoras, while we waited for
some sign from our absent friends.  Gimli said to me on the afternoon
of the day they left that we should make the most of this interval of
peace to rest and regain our strength.  He was right, of course, but
it wasn't that easy.  The threat of Mordor hung over us all still,
like a huge boulder on a slowly fraying string above our heads.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">More than that, Aragorn
was restless, uncomfortable in the knowledge that Theoden was
unwilling to bring his people further into the war.  I discussed the
situation with him on more than one occasion and found him torn
between a desire to argue the point with the Rohan king and a fear of
highlighting the distinction between their senses of duty when he was
housed as a guest in Theoden's court.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry, on the other
hand, had no interest in the wider aspect of events.  All his
thoughts were bent on Pippin and what might be happening to him now
that he was out of his cousin's company.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I came upon him one
morning, standing on the platform outside the Hall of Meduseld, his
eyes fixed on the horizon in the direction of Minas Tirith.  I
approached him and laid a friendly hand on his shoulder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Pippin will be
alright, Merry,&rdquo; I reassured him.  &ldquo;He has Gandalf to
protect him, after all.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;How can you be
so sure?&rdquo; the young hobbit replied, doubt clouding his words. 
&ldquo;You've seen how much trouble Pippin can get himself into, and
that was when I was around to watch out for him.  I didn't have
anything to do but look after him, and he still orchestrated several
disasters.  Gandalf will have many much more important things to take
his attention away from Pippin.  And in a huge city, full of
strangers, just think what kind of mischief he could end up in!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He had a point.  &ldquo;That
may be true,&rdquo; I conceded.  &ldquo;However, it may be that his
experience with the Palantir has taught him a valuable lesson.  He
seemed very shaken by it, as I can well imagine I would be, and that
may temper his behaviour from now on.  Perhaps his separation from
you will also have an effect &ndash; without you to get him out of
trouble, he may think more before he gets himself into it.  It may be
that now is the time for young Peregrine Took to finally grow up a
little.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;But he's so far
away,&rdquo; Merry said, his voice trembling a little.  &ldquo;And
he's gone into a war zone.  That's no place for a hobbit.  Even if he
doesn't bring trouble down on himself, how will he be able to avoid
it, when Sauron attacks the city?&rdquo;  He looked up at me
solemnly.  &ldquo;And what if I don't want him to grow up?  He may be
stupid and foolish and annoying, but he wouldn't be Pippin if he
wasn't.  What if when we meet again, he's changed and he doesn't need
me any more?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">These were questions I
could not answer, so I simply squeezed Merry's shoulder and stood
silently with him while he worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*  *  *  *  *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On the morning of the
fifth day after Pippin and Gandalf's departure, I was sitting with
Gimli inside the Hall of Meduseld, finishing off breakfast.  We had
been discussing Aragorn's restlessness and propensity for spending
most of his time watching the Edoras end of the beacon line. 
Suddenly, the doors burst open and Aragorn rushed in, skidding to a
halt just inside the threshold.  Everyone stared at him in alarm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The beacons of
Minas Tirith!  The beacons are lit!  Gondor calls for aid!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I could see the
desperate hope in his face that Theoden would change his mind about
helping Gondor and, beneath that, the rigid determination to act even
without Theoden.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The hall remained
silent while everyone turned their attention to Theoden expectantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">After several long
moments, he rose to the challenge of the moment, declaring proudly,
&ldquo;And Rohan will answer!  Muster the Rohirrim!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer exchanged a long
look with his sister and touched her shoulder with affection before
bowing and leaving the hall to obey his king's command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn stepped up
before Theoden, eyeing him as an equal but offering his services as a
subordinate.  &ldquo;Give me and my companions whatever orders are
necessary for us to aid in your preparations, my lord.  We are at
your disposal for as long as fate keeps us in your company.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo;
Theoden replied gravely.  &ldquo;Make ready your horses and
equipment.  We will ride within the hour.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It took me far less
time than that to gather my belongings and saddle Arod, so I was
already waiting in the courtyard when the king emerged from the hall
to give instructions to his men.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Assemble the
army at Dunharrow; as many men as can be found.  You have two days,&rdquo;
he told Eomer, who set off immediately.  &ldquo;Gamling, make haste
across the Riddermark.  Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Edoras was a hive of
organised chaos, with men and horses moving everywhere, but everyone
seeming to know exactly where they should be and never getting in
anyone else's way.  Gimli joined me in a corner, where I was
attempting to prevent my presence causing any disruption.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I saw yon wench,
Eowyn, readying her horse,&rdquo; he told me, a glint in his eye.  &ldquo;I
swear that girl would join us on the battlefield if she could find a
way.  She made sure she was close to Aragorn in the procession as
well.  She's not going to give up on him easily.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Then he should
make his feelings more clear to her,&rdquo; I replied softly.  &ldquo;It
does no good for him to be charming and polite.  It'll only make her
think she has a chance with him and make things harder for the both
of them in the long run.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli looked at me
appraisingly.  &ldquo;Clear signals haven't helped you any, though,
have they?&rdquo;  He cast his eyes to the sky.  &ldquo;What is it
about that boy, that has everyone within range drooling over him?  I
mean, I love the lad like a brother, but I just can't see it myself.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I grinned at him. 
&ldquo;Come on, old dwarf  It's time to get you back in the saddle.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He grumbled but
complied.  As we rode Arod towards the gates, he snorted
contemptuously.  &ldquo;Horsemen!  I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Your kinsmen
have no need to ride to war,&rdquo; I told him, expressing the dark
shadow in my heart.  &ldquo;I fear war already marches on their
lands.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He grunted uncertainly,
and we rode the rest of the way in silence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer had gathered his
soldiers at the gate.  &ldquo;Now is the hour, Riders of Rohan!&rdquo;
he cried.  &ldquo;Oaths you have taken &ndash; now fulfil them all! 
To Lord and Land!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There was a great
cheer, and the Rohirrim set out to war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*  *  *  *  *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer and Gamling must
have ridden like the wind to wherever it was they went since, when we
rode into Dunharrow the following day, there were a significant
number of warriors there before us.  The gathering did not seem to
impress Theoden, however.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;
he called out to a soldier standing at the side of the roadway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I bring five
hundred men from the Westfold, my lord,&rdquo; came the reply.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;We have three
hundred more from Fenmarch,&rdquo; Gamling reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Theoden asked, &ldquo;Where
are the riders from Snowbourn?&rdquo;  His face was grim, and I could
tell that he was not happy with the turnout.  Gamling's next words
did not help matters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;None have come,
my lord.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Theoden led us, and all
those who had come with us from Edoras, up a steep and winding path
to the top of a cliff, overlooking the encampment.  It was not long
before tents had sprouted up all over the grassy field, one being
assigned to Gimli and myself, with Arod tethered nearby.  Aragorn
stayed with Theoden, so Gimli and I explored the camp by ourselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There was a crack in
the mountain at the far side of the clearing, and I noticed several
men having difficulty controlling their horses near it.  The animals
whickered and pranced, unwilling to stay long in the vicinity of the
pathway.  I thought I knew the reason why and, spotting Eomer, I
walked over to him, Gimli following at my back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The horses are
restless,&rdquo; I said by way of broaching the subject.  &ldquo;And
the men are quiet.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;They grow
nervous in the shadow of the mountain,&rdquo; Eomer replied,
gesturing at the track behind us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli was more direct,
as always.  &ldquo;That road there; where does that lead?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I hazarded my guess. 
&ldquo;It is the road to the Dimholt; the door under the mountain.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;None who venture
there ever return.  That mountain is evil,&rdquo; Eomer confirmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As we spoke, Aragorn
left Theoden's side and wandered towards the opening of the pathway,
an intent look on his face.  He stood for a moment, then started as
if he had seen something in the shadows.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Oblivious, Gimli
stomped up beside him and laid a hand on his arm.  Ever sure to have
his priorities straight, he said, &ldquo;Aragorn.  Let's find some
food.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn allowed himself
to be led away, but he looked back towards the mountain as he moved. 
I raised an eyebrow of enquiry at him, but he just shrugged and shook
his head.  He looked a little shaken, though, and I wondered what he
thought he had seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A kitchen had been set
up a little way away from our accommodations, so we collected some
stew and found a place out of the way to enjoy our lunch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn was serious. 
&ldquo;King Theoden does not believe many more men will be coming to
join us.  I am worried that our efforts will be in vain.  We have
already seen the number of troops Saruman commanded.  Surely the army
of Sauron himself will be far greater.  Those we have here will not
be able to match them on an open battlefield.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;But we must
try,&rdquo; I reminded him needlessly.  &ldquo;Better to die in
battle than be slaughtered in our homes as we await our doom without
lifting a finger.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Of course,
Legolas,&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;So there is little point in
worrying about it now, is there?  We will do what we can, and hope
for the best.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And in the
meantime, we'll enjoy our stew!&rdquo; Gimli said, ever the
pragmatist.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn and I could not
help smiling at him, and I wondered at how my opinion of the gruff
dwarf had changed since that first meeting at Rivendell, that seemed
so long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*  *  *  *  *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Later, I lay awake in
my tent, listening to Gimli snore, and thinking about what Aragorn
had said.  Where was our hope now?  Was the only thing we had to look
forward to really death at the hands of Saruman's army, on the fields
before Minas Tirith?  Surely, after all our efforts and sacrifices,
our journey would not end like that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As if in answer to my
thoughts, I felt a familiar presence nearby.  I recognised it as
Elrond, but why was he here?  With what little mental power I had at
my command, I sent a questing thought towards him.  In return, I
received an image of Aragorn, a mighty sword, and the dark mountain
that rose above us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The shards of Narsil
had been re-forged!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Immediately, I roused
Gimli.  He came awake with a grunt and glared at me ferociously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Elrond is here,&rdquo;
I told him quickly.  &ldquo;The blade that was broken has been
re-forged.  He has come to push Aragorn towards his destiny.  And we
must be there to accompany him.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Why must you
always speak in riddles?&rdquo; Gimli grumbled.  &ldquo;Damned elves
and their pretentious ways.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I sighed in
frustration.  &ldquo;Aragorn is about to leave the camp, to travel
the Dimholt road.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Well, why didn't
you just say so?  I'll get my axe.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We dressed and
collected our gear as quickly as possible, and I saddled Arod while
Gimli huffed impatiently.  Within a few minutes, we were making our
way through the dark of the camp towards Aragorn's tent.  There were
still men about and they watched us with interest.  As we approached,
I heard voices and pulled Arod to a halt, gesturing for Gimli to be
quiet.  Eowyn's words drifted out of the darkness towards us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Why are you
doing this?  The war lies to the East, you cannot leave on the eve of
battle!&rdquo;  There was a brief pause before she continued.  &ldquo;You
cannot abandon the men.&rdquo;  I knew that was not what she really
wanted to say, and my heart went out to her in understanding that
only I could truly give.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Eowyn...&rdquo; 
Aragorn sounded tired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;We need you
here,&rdquo; she persisted, pleadingly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Why have you
come?&rdquo; came his reply, cutting to the heart of the matter and
urging her to speak more plainly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">She was silent for a
long moment, then she said softly, &ldquo;Do you not know?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I felt Aragorn's sorrow
as he sighed, and I imagined that he spoke his next words to me as
well as to the lovely young woman who stood before him with her heart
in her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;It is but a
shadow and a thought that you love.  I have wished you joy since
first I saw you.&rdquo;  He spoke gently and with great affection as
he took away her hope.  &ldquo;I cannot give you what you seek.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I exchanged a pointed
glance with Gimli, who looked uncomfortable at having overheard such
a private moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As Aragorn came into
view, leading Brego towards the mountain, Gimli stomped up behind him
and demanded, &ldquo;Just where do you think you're off to?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn set his
features into what he must have thought was fierce determination. 
&ldquo;Not this time.  This time you must stay, Gimli.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But the dwarf
resolutely stood his ground, and I came up to join him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Have you heard
nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?&rdquo; I said lightly, trying
to relieve the tension of the moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Might as well
accept it,&rdquo; Gimli reasoned.  &ldquo;We're going with you,
laddie.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Yes, I thought, I have
made a promise and I do not intend to break it now, not even if it
means travelling beneath the mountain and perhaps never coming out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn smiled, and led
us down the Dimholt road, with the alarmed shouts and angry questions
of the Rohirrim to send us on our way and, somewhere, a golden-haired
maiden watching us sadly as we left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">*  *  *  *  *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We rode in silence as
the dawn brought light to the landscape around us.  I could sense
that the horses were nervous; Arod's muscles were clenched beneath me
and his ears twitched at every tiny sound of our progress.  I tried
to convey calm through my body into his, but I fear my own
apprehension prevented me from being very convincing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The rocks around us
provided a path of unending greay, surrounded by hostile walls and
treacherous footholds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At last, Gimli broke
the silence.  &ldquo;What kind of army would linger in such a place?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">His voice brought my
mind back to my companions, and I was glad of an excuse to throw
words into the dead air that felt steeped with oppression.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;One that is
cursed,&rdquo; I told him, dredging up the story from the depths of
my memory.  &ldquo;Long ago, the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to
the last king of Gondor.  To come to his aid, to fight.  But when the
time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled &ndash; vanishing
into the darkness of the mountain.&rdquo;  I suppressed a shudder at
the thought of them trying to save themselves by fleeing into this
cold, empty place.  &ldquo;And so Isildur cursed them; never to rest,
until they had fulfilled their pledge.&rdquo; I lost myself for a
moment in the old tale, reciting the prophecy that concluded it. 
&ldquo;Who shall call them from the grey twilight?  The forgotten
people.  The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.  From the north
shall he come.  Need shall drive him.  He shall pass the door to the
Paths of the Dead.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">And this is where we
found ourselves.  As the echo of those last words faded away, the
door came into view before us, a dark hole cut into the side of the
mountain, leading into a pit, the contents of which no man had ever
returned to tell.  We dismounted from the horses and led them
forwards slowly.  A breath of air wafted out of the opening, bringing
with it a sour feeling of decay that set the hairs on the back of my
neck on edge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The very warmth
of my blood seems drawn away,&rdquo; Gimli muttered, betraying a
greater sensitivity than I had credited him with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The words above the
opening drew my eye and I read them aloud.  &ldquo;The way is shut. 
It was made by those who are dead.  And the dead keep it.  The way is
shut.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As I spoke, a sudden
blast of wind erupted from the doorway, the air mingled with faint
cries of anguish and torment.  Both horses started up and pulled away
from us, running in fear back the way they had come.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Brego!&rdquo;
Aragorn called, but did not move to follow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Instead, he turned
resolutely to the entrance, cried, &ldquo;I do not fear death!&rdquo;
and strode into the blackness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I exchanged a fearful
glance with Gimli, but there was no choice in the matter for me. 
Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself for whatever terrors lay ahead
and followed Aragorn, as I had pledged I would.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I heard Gimli behind me
gearing himself up.  &ldquo;Well, this is something unheard of!  An
Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?  Ahh, I'll never hear
the end of it!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">His footsteps sounded
in the darkness behind me, and I was glad of his solid presence at my
back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I soon caught up with
Aragorn, who had slowed to a cautious walk as the tunnel opened out
ahead of us.  Light emanated from a strange mist that circled us,
clinging to our clothes as if trying to detain us.  I peered ahead
and gasped as I saw the mist coalescing into recognisable forms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
called Gimli from behind me, obviously alarmed by my reaction.  &ldquo;What
do you see?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I see shapes of
men,&rdquo; I told him.  &ldquo;And of horses.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he
demanded, clearly unable to see them for himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The mist swirled in and
out of my awareness, mesmerising me with its movements, forming clear
shapes and then dissolving away in a maddening fashion that kept my
gaze searching for solidity within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Pale banners
like shreds of cloud,&rdquo; I murmured, describing what I saw as it
changed before my eyes.  &ldquo;Spears rising... like winter thickets
through a shroud of mist.&rdquo;  I caught a sense of foreboding in
the mist and suddenly knew from whence it emanated.  &ldquo;The Dead
are following.  They have been summoned.&rdquo;  Summoned by our
presence, I surmised.  After all, they claimed to guard the passage,
not allowing anything that lived to see the other side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli harrumphed.  &ldquo;The
Dead?  Summoned?  I knew that.&rdquo;  He tried to hide his
nervousness with a chuckle.  &ldquo;Very good.  Very good.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">His mutterings grew
fainter as I followed Aragorn further into the cavern.  Then, a shout
of, &ldquo;Legolas!&rdquo; told me the dwarf was once again hurrying
to keep up with us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As we progressed, the
mist surrounding us started to form into hands, with fingers that
grasped at us.  I lifted my arms away from the ghostly fingers and
pressed on.  Soon afterwards, I stepped on something that crunched
beneath my feet.  Aragorn warned us not to look down at the ground,
but it was impossible to resist the temptation.  What greeted my
peering gaze were piles of human skulls, packed into the ground in
such a way that it was impossible to avoid treading on them. 
Nonetheless, I ventured onwards, careful to keep Aragorn in sight,
and also making sure that Gimli did not get too far behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eventually, the tunnel
broadened out even more into a large open space.  We stopped before a
set of huge double doors, which dominated one wall of the cavern.  An
eerie feeling filled the air around us and I could sense countless
unseen eyes viewing us from some hidden recess.  Whoever dwelt here
was well aware that we were there; all we could do was wait for them
to show themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It did not take long. 
As we took in our surroundings, a disembodied voice suddenly called
out, &ldquo;Who enters my domain?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I spun back round to
face the doors, and a ghost-like figure appeared on the steps in
front of them.  It carried a sword and wore a crown, its long hair
framing a face that was part flesh and part exposed bone.  It seemed
to be made out of the mist we had seen before, its figure exuding a
sickly green light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn stepped forward
calmly and replied, &ldquo;One who would have your allegiance.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The dead do not
suffer the living to pass.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I could feel Gimli's
tension as he stood beside me, his gaze riveted to the apparition. 
Aragaorn, however, remained utterly unfazed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He said firmly, &ldquo;You
will suffer me!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ghost king let out
a laugh of pure contempt.  As if this was a signal to advance, more
shapes appeared out of the darkness, moving forwards to completely
surround us.  They were all formed from the green mist, all dressed
as soldiers, but not whole men.  Some had skeletal arms, others
sported missing features; all were clearly hostile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Their king pronounced,
&ldquo;The way is shut.  It was made by those who are dead, and the
dead keep it.&rdquo;  His soldiers pressed closer, and he repeated,
&ldquo;The way is shut.  Now you must die.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He moved towards
Aragorn, and my instincts took over.  I know it was stupid to think
loosing an arrow at a ghost would be effective, but I was working on
pure impulse, attempting to protect my friend.  Unsurprisingly, the
arrow passed straight through the ghost's head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Both ghost and Aragorn
ignored my attempted intervention.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn stated, &ldquo;I
summon you to fulfil your oath.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;None but the
king of Gondor may command me!&rdquo; the ghost claimed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, it swung its
sword at Aragorn, who blocked the blow expertly with his newly forged
blade.  The metal clashed together, clearly startling the ghost king,
who found himself with the point of an elven sword against his neck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;That line was
broken!&rdquo; he cried in disbelief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I had never heard
Aragorn sound so confident and determined as when he replied, &ldquo;It
has been remade.&rdquo;  This was a man facing up to his destiny,
prepared to do whatever it might take to get the job done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn pushed the
ghost king forcibly back, and all the misty figures stood and watched
the confrontation in silence.  The atmosphere was tense.  I realised
that, if the king commanded the soldiers to attack us, Aragorn would
be only one who could stand against them, and even he could not face
so many without defeat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Fight for us and
regain your honour,&rdquo; he offered, speaking now to the whole
host.  &ldquo;What say you?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He began to walk a
circle around myself and Gimli, staying between us and the ghostly
soldiers, holding out his sword for them to see.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What say you?&rdquo;
he repeated more urgently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli said, &ldquo;You
waste your time, Aragorn!  They had no honour in life, they have none
now in death.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn ignored him,
focusing all his attention on the troops lined up before him.  &ldquo;I
am Isildur's heir.  Fight for me!  And I will hold your oaths
fulfilled!&rdquo;  He changed direction and circled the king,
repeating, &ldquo;What say you?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I could see in him a
great military leader, who would be able to command the love and
loyalty of any men who served under him.  But these were not men,
they were shadows of former traitors, who would not be swayed by
impassioned rhetoric.  The king merely laughed and all the soldiers
began to melt away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Desperate now, Aragorn
cried, &ldquo;You have my word!  Fight, and I will release you from
this living death!  What say you?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">They gave their answer
by vanishing as quickly as they had appeared, the king's laughter
echoing around us as we stood in the darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli shouted, &ldquo;Stand,
you traitors!&rdquo; but they were gone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A chill wind sprung up
from nowhere, and a distant cracking sound alerted me to coming
danger.  Before I could act, however, hundreds of skulls started
pouring out of the crumbling walls beside the gates.  In seconds, we
were deluged with them, an avalanche of skulls descending upon us,
until we were knee deep in them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Legolas!  Run!&rdquo;
Aragorn called, spurring me into action.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I grabbed Gimli and
shoved him ahead of me as the skulls continued to rain down,
seemingly without end.  We fought our way through them, struggling to
maintain our footing, choking on the dust brought down with them.  I
thought for a moment we would die there, buried beneath the remains
of those from whom we had come to seek help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, at last,
daylight shone ahead and we burst out on the other side of the
mountain.  The sudden brightness after such gloom dazzled my eyes
but, when my vision cleared, I looked down to see the river below us.
 On the water, the black-sailed ships of Sauron's mercenaries hove
into view, on their way to Minas Tirith.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn took a couple
of steps and then dropped to his knees in the grass, despair pouring
from him in waves.  Knowing that words would do no good, I moved up
to him and put my arm around his shoulders, offering my mute support.
 In a rare moment of weakness, he leaned back against me, and I felt
his sorrow at his failure.  I took no pleasure in the feel of his
body resting against mine, only grateful that he felt able to accept
comfort from me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We remained there a
long moment, as the ships sailed towards us, unstoppable in their
numbers, with only us three ranged against them.  Then, the sound of
rushing wind came from behind us.  Aragorn rose and turned back
towards the mountain, Gimli and I mirroring his movements.  As we
watched, the ghost king melted through the rock to stand before us in
the open air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He said simply, &ldquo;We
fight.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn closed his eyes
briefly, a smile of relief brushing his lips.  Then he nodded
acknowledgement to the ghost king and said simply, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;We do not fight
for your thanks,&rdquo; the apparition replied flatly.  &ldquo;We
fight for our freedom.  We weary of our endless existence here;  we
desire release.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And that is what
I shall grant you once our battle is done,&rdquo; Aragorn promised. 
&ldquo;First we must deal with the ships below.  Wait for my signal
before you join the fray.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ghost king nodded
and melted from view.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn turned back
towards the river, his demeanour determined.  It warmed my heart to
see his confidence renewed.  With a glance at us, he strode down the
hillside, not needing to tell us to follow him.  Gimli grinned and
gestured for me to precede him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the three of us
reached the river bank, the first ship was just approaching, enabling
us to converse easily with the crew, a motley-looking bunch of
mercenaries.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn stood firm on
the bank, his body radiating charisma, as if he could halt all the
ships with just a glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;You may go no
further,&rdquo; he called out.  &ldquo;You will not enter Gondor.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One of the crew stepped
forward, presumably the captain, though there was nothing in his
apparel to distinguish him from the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Who are you to
deny us passage?&rdquo; he demanded contemptuously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn spoke casually
over his shoulder.  &ldquo;Legolas, fire a warning shot past the
bosun's ear.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Smiling, I drew an
arrow from my quiver and set it to my bow.  As I pulled back the
string to fire, Gimli warned me to watch my aim and bumped my arm
just as I let the arrow fly.  It struck the bosun full in the chest
and he toppled to the deck.  Outraged as his interference, I threw
Gimli an angry glance, but he seemed unrepentant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;That's it,&rdquo;
he called.  &ldquo;Right.  We warned you.  Prepare to be boarded.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Little affected by the
death of their comrade, the corsairs laughed uproariously at the
dwarf's seemingly ridiculous statement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The captain said,
&ldquo;Boarded?  By you and whose army?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This, of course, was
the moment Aragorn had been waiting for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;This army,&rdquo;
he announced with a grim smile, giving the signal to the ghost king
to appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a dramatic gesture I
had not expected from the dead ruler, the apparition swept through
Aragorn as he appeared, making it look as if Aragorn had summoned him
from within himself.  The ranks of soldiers formed up behind their
leader and swept across the distance between the bank and the ship. 
Their insubstantiality allowed them to float over the water, and they
swarmed over the vessels in their hundreds.  The amusement of the
corsairs rapidly turned to terror as they were attacked by enemies
they quickly discovered they could not harm.  The battle was a short
one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When it was over, I
felt somewhat dissatisfied.  The three of us had not contributed at
all, being stuck on the bank, but we had caused the death of all
those men, giving them no chance to defend themselves.  It seemed
wrong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli obviously picked
up on my mood, coming to stand next to me.  &ldquo;We gave them the
opportunity to surrender,&rdquo; he pointed out weakly.  I looked
askance at him.  &ldquo;Yes, well,&rdquo; he continued.  &ldquo;You've
got to look at the bigger picture, Legolas.  It may not be the best
way to wage a war, but we've got to use the tools at our disposal. 
Surely, you'd not rather let Sauron win?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo;
I replied.  &ldquo;I know you're right.  It's just...&rdquo;  I
gestured expansively at the fleet of ships on which so many live had
just been extinguished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli patted me on the
arm.  &ldquo;I know, lad, I know.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ghost army took up
posts on the ships, those on the first one throwing us lines so that
we could moor it long enough to board ourselves.  Then we set sail
for Minas Tirith, the first stage of our journey complete.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was an eerie way to
travel, sharing a boat with a ghostly crew, who floated around the
deck, completing their tasks without a sound.  The fleet of ships
followed behind us, as silent as ours.  Gimli exchanged many glances
with me along the way, grimacing or rolling his eyes at our ethereal
companions, though obviously unwilling to make comments about his
feelings when in such close proximity and without an easy escape. 
Aragorn stayed at the helm of the ship, staring ahead with an
intensity that did not invite conversation, so it was a less than
companionable journey, all told.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ghost soldiers were
evidently competent sailors and clearly needed no assistance from me,
so I kept out of the way, stationing myself at the bow and training
my gaze on the river ahead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">By the time we reached
the docks at Minas Tirith, I was itching for some activity, all my
senses on edge and ready for battle.  This turned out to be a good
thing, since we were hailed almost immediately by orcs on the shore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Late as usual! 
Pirate scum!&rdquo; one called, obviously mistaking us for the
mercenaries hired by Sauron.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s knife work here
that needs doing!  Come on, you sea-rats.  Get off your ships!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As ready as I was,
Aragorn leapt over the side of the ship onto the dockside, sword in
hand.  Gimli and I followed directly behind him, also with our
weapons at the ready.  Shock registered on the faces of the orcs
before us, quickly followed by disdain as no others appeared to
support us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;There are plenty
for the both of us,&rdquo; Gimli told me, referencing the competition
at the battle of Helm&rsquo;s Deep.  &ldquo;May the best dwarf win.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn charged into
the fray, and the ghost army swarmed off the ships behind us,
sweeping across the water from multiple ships to join the battle.  I
held back, utilising my bow for as long as possible before moving to
hand-to-hand fighting.  I realised from my experience under the
mountain that my weapons could not harm the ghosts, so I did not
bother to take note of where they were, firing arrows through them to
pierce the orcs on the other side.  The arrows did not appear to
affect their concentration, so I carried on, hoping I would not have
angry ghost soldiers to contend with after the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We fought our way
quickly across the docks and out onto the plain in front of the city.
 I was stopped in my tracks by the sight that greeted us.  Thousands
upon thousands of men, orcs, trolls and other creatures waged war
beneath the walls of Minas Tirith.  We had arrived too late to see
the start of the battle and it was certainly in full swing now.  I
only hoped that those friends I knew were on the field were still
alright, but had no hope of finding any familiar faces amongst the
hordes of fighters.  There was no time to think about the greater
picture; we were needed and we fought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I managed to stay close
to Gimli as we made our way into the fray, wanting to keep a familiar
figure nearby.  We bolstered each other by periodically shouting out
the count of our kills, which rapidly reached double figures.  As
Gimli had said at the dock, there were more than enough enemies to
keep both of us busy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Every orc I cut down
was instantly replaced by two more.  I closed my mind to everything
but the battle immediately before me, just keeping a sliver of
awareness available to track Gimli&rsquo;s and Aragorn&rsquo;s
progress across the field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I heard Aragorn call my
name and spun round to see a giant Mumakil bearing down on me.  I
tracked its movement for a few long moments, then leaped in the air
and caught hold of one huge tusk as the creature passed by.  From
there, I jumped to its front leg, where I could use the many arrows
protruding from its tough skin to climb higher.  I scrambled up onto
its back, firing at the warriors atop it as I went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Thirty-three,
thirty-four,&rdquo; I counted almost without thinking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Several painted
soldiers launched themselves at me, but I managed to push them off
balance and send them tumbling to the ground below.  I heard their
screams as they were trampled beneath the Mumkil&rsquo;s enormous
feet, but had no time to dwell on their fate.  I grabbed a nearby
rope and swung round to the creature&rsquo;s back legs, noting where
the harness joined together to hold the main tower in place.  I
sliced at the ropes and allowed the weight of the tower sliding of
the Mumakil&rsquo;s back to pull me upright, trying to let go at just
the right moment to maintain my balance.  I mistimed it slightly and
the rope was yanked out of my hand by the falling tower, wrenching my
arm painfully.  The tower structure crashed to the ground on the far
side of the creature, and was instantly swarming with ghost soldiers,
who looked like some kind of insect infestation from above.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now that the Mumakil
was free from any other passengers, I strode up to its neck and fired
three arrows simultaneously into its brain.  It staggered and fell. 
Aiming for a dramatic finish, I leaped onto its trunk and slid down
it, jumping off the end to land with a flourish directly in front of
Gimli, who was staring open-mouthed at the massive carcass behind me.
 I couldn&rsquo;t resist a self-satisfied grin in his direction, but
he feigned being entirely unimpressed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;That still only
counts as one!&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Alright then, come on!&rdquo; 
And we turned together to face the enemies that kept on coming.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I don&rsquo;t know how
long we fought.  My wrenched arm forced me to resort to hand-to-hand
combat, using only one blade, which curtailed my success somewhat. 
At one point, as I was fighting off one orc, another came at me from
behind, grabbing my injured arm and wrenching it further.  I felt
something give in my shoulder joint and cried out at the pain but
managed to keep fighting and kill both orcs.  My left arm was
completely useless after that and I was sure the shoulder was
dislocated at the very least.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Minutes, hours, days
later &ndash; I could not tell &ndash; an orc fell from my sword
blade and no other rose up before me to replace it.  I staggered
slightly as my fighting movements came to a halt, my limbs seemingly
moving of their own volition, with no conscious instruction from me. 
I glanced around me, disoriented for a moment, then my gaze alighted
on Aragorn and my heart leapt in relief.  Gimli stumped over to my
side and grinned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;One hundred and
thirty-eight!&rdquo; he declared triumphantly.  &ldquo;Beat that!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It took me a moment to
understand what he meant, and he obviously noticed my confusion, as
his expression grew concerned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Are you hurt,
Legolas?&rdquo; he asked me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I managed to smile down
at him, recovering my composure.  &ldquo;I'm afraid I have to confess
to having lost count somewhere along the way.  To my mind, that must
mean my score was far in excess of one hundred and thirty-eight, as
it would take a vast number to cause me to lose track.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; 
Gimli was unconvinced.  &ldquo;No score means disqualification!  I
claim the victory!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I hadn't the energy to
argue with him, so I merely turned and led him over to where Aragorn
stood before the army of the dead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Release us,&rdquo;
the ghost king was saying as we approached.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Bad idea,&rdquo;
Gimli advised.  &ldquo;Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I could see his point;
the dead army had swung the battle in our favour, defeating the
opposing forces with a speed and ruthlessness we would never have
achieved without them.  However, I knew Aragorn would never betray
their trust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;You gave us your
word,&rdquo; the dead king growled, an unnecessary reminder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn declared, &ldquo;I
hold your oath fulfilled.  Go.  Be at peace.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ghostly king smiled
with obvious pleasure and slowly melted away, all the soldiers
disappearing with him.  As Gimli clearly agreed, I thought it would
have been useful for them to remain a while longer, as I knew the war
was not over yet, but they had done as they had promised and had
earned their freedom.  I wished them joy of their long-awaited rest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf had appeared
some time during this exchange, a very welcome sight.  He bowed to
Aragorn, acknowledging the signs that Aragorn had once more taken up
his destiny.  There was no opportunity for the wizard to speak,
however, since the air was suddenly rent by a cry of pure despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We all turned in the
direction of the sound to see Eomer flinging himself to the ground
some distance away and pulling a body up into his arms.  Long,
flowing blonde hair spilled over the trampled grass and I realised
with a jolt that it was Eowyn who lay unmoving in her brother's
embrace.  Eomer's continued cries pierced my heart and I sorrowed
that such a vibrant flame should be extinguished, even as I wondered
how she came to be there on the battlefield.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn strode to
Eomer's side and knelt down next to him, though he seemed oblivious
to the presence of anyone else in his overwhelming grief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn looked up from
Eowyn's body and said, &ldquo;She yet lives.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer raised his gaze
and stared at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Quickly!&rdquo;
Aragorn commanded.  &ldquo;Bring her inside the city.  I may be able
to save her.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer scrambled to his
feet, clutching Eowyn to him, and followed Aragorn silently as he
strode back across the field towards the city.  I could see others
roaming the battlefield all around us, scanning the ground for
friends, loved ones, anyone who might still be alive.  Gimli and I
joined the procession heading to the city.  I, for one, had no desire
to stay among the dead any longer than necessary, and I also wanted
to make sure that Aragorn got some rest, as I knew he would drive
himself into the ground trying to help the victims of the battle,
despite his own exertions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In fact, I got little
chance to see to Aragorn's needs as it was impossible to get near him
once he entered the Houses of Healing inside Minas Tirith.  There
were so many casualties and so few healers, I would not have been
able to drag him away if I had tried.  I knew he would work until
either there were no more patients to tend or he actually collapsed
from exhaustion, so I decided to stay and make sure the latter didn't
happen.  I found a seat on a bench at the back of the main hall and
sat down to wait.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I watched him move
among the wounded, giving comfort and ministration wherever it was
needed, and I marvelled at his energy and dedication.  I could see he
truly felt responsible for all these people, even though he knew
almost none of them.  He started, of course, with Eowyn, while Eomer
sat nearby, his face a picture of misery and fear.  I knew exactly
how he felt; helpless and utterly frustrated by the feeling.  Eomer
was a man of action, and now he could do nothing while his sister lay
perhaps dying just feet away.  Aragorn, however, focused all his
attention on his patient; it was as if Eowyn was the only person in
the entire world while he was tending her.  I felt a pang in my heart
that he would never turn that intensity of attention on me, then
cursed myself for a self-centred fool when I realised where my
thoughts had led me.  How could I be jealous of a young woman who lay
on the edge of death?  I blamed fatigue from the battle and the
incessant ache in my shoulder for my weakness and resolutely shifted
my mind elsewhere.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A distraction soon
presented itself.  A commotion at the door brought my attention to a
Gondorian soldier, who strode in with a small body in his arms.  A
shorter figure, also dressed in the livery of Minas Tirith, followed
on his heels and it took me a moment to register that it was Pippin. 
The hobbit rushed forwards when he caught sight of Aragorn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;It's Merry!&rdquo;
he cried.  &ldquo;I found him on the battlefield.  He's hurt &ndash;
please help him!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn rose at once,
not forgetting to give Eomer a reassuring pat on the shoulder as he
did so, and crossed hurriedly to the pallet where the soldier was
laying down his small burden.  I knew there was nothing I could do to
help, and thought I would only get in the way if I went to join them,
so I remained where I was, praying with all my heart that Merry was
not mortally injured.  After everything we had been through, I could
not bear the thought that one of the hobbits should lose his life in
a battle on the other side of Middle Earth from his home.    War is
always an ugly thing, and has very little justice in it, but I
couldn't believe in a world where innocence could be blighted so
irrevocably.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I felt tears burning my
eyes, so I clenched them shut, unwilling to lose my composure
completely in these strange surroundings.  I thought I only sat there
like that for a moment, but I must have drifted into a doze.  I was
roused by a hand on my uninjured shoulder and opened my eyes to see
Aragorn standing over me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Legolas,&rdquo;
he murmured.  &ldquo;How long have you been sitting here?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I glanced around,
slightly disoriented.  &ldquo;I'm not sure.  I came to make sure you
got some rest, but clearly I've not been fulfilling that duty.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He sat down heavily on
the bench next to me, clearly exhausted.  &ldquo;Well, I appreciate
the thought.  I think I've finally done all I can here, so I'll
happily fulfil your duty for you by taking myself to bed.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;How is Eowyn?&rdquo;
I wanted to know first.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The bravest
woman I've ever known,&rdquo; was his comment.  &ldquo;Do you know
she took on the Witch King and won?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I gaped at him.  An
image sprang into my mind of the leader of the Nazgul looming over
the slender shieldmaiden, and I was amazed she was still in one
piece.  I had never underestimated her strength of spirit, but such a
feat was beyond anything I could imagine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Will she
recover?&rdquo; I asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn passed a hand
across his face, as if trying to wipe the last few hours from his
mind.  &ldquo;Given time, yes.  Her wound was grievous, and almost
beyond my ability to heal, but she is determined and she has the love
of her brother to keep her anchored.  She will be weak for a long
time but she will recover fully.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I breathed a little
more easily, but there was still one friend to enquire about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And Merry?  I
saw him brought in.  What happened to him?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn smiled in
wonder.  &ldquo;He was Eowyn's partner on the battlefield, of all
things.  He suffered a wound at the hand of the Witch King as well,
trying to defend her from its attack.  He is very lucky; his injury
is not so severe and he, too, has love to anchor him.  If Pippin
hadn't found him out there among the dead, he wouldn't be alive now. 
Pippin hasn't left his side; they're both asleep over there on the
floor.  I wouldn't be surprised to find Merry right as rain by the
morning.&rdquo;  He caught my eye.  &ldquo;Speaking of sleeping,
that's what both of us should be doing.  This isn't over yet, and we
need to take advantage of the respite while we can.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He rose and took hold
of my arm as if to pull me up from the bench.  I hissed at the pain
as he jolted my arm, and his expression immediately turned to one of
concern.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Legolas, are you
injured?  Why didn't you say something?  How bad is it?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I couldn't help but
smile as I realised he had turned all his focus instantly to my
wellbeing, exactly as I had been wishing earlier on.  I had been
stupid not to realise that he would, and I basked in his friendship
for a moment before coming back to my senses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I think I've
dislocated my shoulder, that's all,&rdquo; I reassured him.  &ldquo;There
were many others in far greater need than me, so I didn't want to
trouble you earlier.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn sat down again
and turned to face me, reaching up to probe my shoulder joint through
the material of my tunic.  I sucked in a breath sharply as his
fingers caused the ache to flare, but managed to remain still.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Yes, it's
dislocated,&rdquo; he said after a moment.  Then he shifted and put
one arm around my chest while the other rested against my injured
arm.  He looked deeply into my eyes and continued, &ldquo;On the
count of three, I'm going to push the joint back into place.  Ready?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I nodded, losing myself
in his gaze as he sat inches from me, my pain forgotten for the
moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;One, two -&rdquo;
 Barely on two, he jerked against me and I felt my shoulder realign
itself and explode into fiery agony.  Aragorn held me to him as the
spasm passed, leaving me breathless.  When I looked up, there was an
apology in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;It hurts a lot
less when you're not expecting it,&rdquo; he explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Now, to bed for
both of us, I think,&rdquo; he declared, getting to his feet once
more.  &ldquo;I know how quickly you heal, so you'll probably be fine
by tomorrow, as well, but sleep can do nothing but help.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One of the healers'
attendants showed us to available rooms and I was asleep within
minutes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">* * * * * 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The next morning came
far too quickly.  I realised as I washed and dressed how easy it had
become for me to sleep after a battle and the change worried me a
little.  I knew it would do nobody any good for me to be exhausted
after a sleepless night, but I didn't like the fact that I was
turning into a soldier.  I didn't want to be one of those hardened
veterans who wasn't affected by violence and atrocity any more. 
Could it be possible that I was losing some of my feeling, in order
to survive the battles emotionally as well as physically?  I hoped
not.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I had little time to
dwell on these thoughts, as Gimli strode into my room without
knocking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Aren't you ready
yet?&rdquo; he asked grumpily.  &ldquo;Everyone's waiting in the
throne room.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Where did you
get to last night?&rdquo; I enquired as I fastened the last of my
buckles.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Straight to
sleep for me,&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;Which is what you should
have done.  Don't tell me you stayed up half the night babysitting
Aragorn.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I couldn't help but
smile at his contempt.  &ldquo;That was my plan, but I fell asleep on
duty,&rdquo; I admitted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I told Gimli briefly
about Eowyn and the hobbits, interpreting his various grunts as
expressions of concern and relief over the wellbeing of our friends. 
Then, boots on, I followed him out of the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As we walked down the
corridor, I swung my arm back and forth a couple of times to test my
shoulder.  It still ached, but at least I had full use of my arm, and
I thought it wouldn't hinder me too much if more fighting was
required today.  I had to admit I was as intrigued as I was
apprehensive about the upcoming meeting, as I had no idea what the
overall situation was, or what our next move would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf, Aragorn and
Eomer were gathered in the throne room when we arrived.  Aragorn
looked worn but alert, which I hope meant he had managed to get at
least as much sleep as me.  Eomer's presence suggested that Eowyn was
recovered enough for him to be happy to leave her side, which made me
glad.  Gimli stumped straight past everyone and sat himself down in
the steward's chair without ceremony, fumbling for his pipe and
lighting it as the debate began.  I took up a position on the main
floor, supporting my injured shoulder with my other arm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf looked grave. 
&ldquo;Frodo has passed beyond my sight.  The darkness is deepening.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This was not what I
wanted to hear the morning after a major victory for our side, but of
course the larger task of destroying the Ring was still far from
over.  In fact, as Gandalf pointed out, we had no idea of the status
of Frodo and Sam, though Aragorn immediately stated the other side of
the case.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;If Sauron had
the Ring, we would know it,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;It's only a
matter of time,&rdquo; Gandalf countered, pessimistically.  &ldquo;He
has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy
is regrouping.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Let him stay
there,&rdquo; Gimli said forcefully.  &ldquo;Let him rot!  Why should
we care?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf turned to face
him, his expression stern.  &ldquo;Because ten thousand orcs now
stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.  I have sent him to his death.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I had never heard the
wizard &ndash; our guide and mentor &ndash; sound so negative, and it
frightened me.  Gandalf had never been less than realistic, but this
was fatalism, an attitude we could not afford to indulge in, if we
were to maintain our resistance against Sauron.  Luckily, Aragorn
seemed to have stepped in to fill the role of motivator in Gandalf's
stead.  Where Gandalf was being weakened by his guilt over the fate
of Frodo, Aragorn had been bolstered by his experience with the ghost
army and subsequent saving of so many people in the battle the day
before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
said firmly.  &ldquo;There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time,
and safe passage across the plains of Gorgorath.  We can give him
that.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;How?&rdquo;
Gimli wanted to know, his tone suggesting an eagerness to act.  I was
glad he was responding to Aragorn's determination rather than
Gandalf's pessimism, as I knew he was prone to bouts of frustration
and despair, like any of us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Draw out
Sauron's armies,&rdquo; was Aragorn's plan.  &ldquo;Empty his lands. 
Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli choked on his
pipe smoke at this pronouncement, and I admit I felt myself quail at
the thought of such an audacious move.  After the battle of the day
before, the last thing I wanted to do was march against vastly
superior forces in what was sure to be suicide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eomer spoke for all of
us.  &ldquo;We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It seemed that Aragorn
was well aware of this, and it did not change his thoughts.  &ldquo;Not
for ourselves,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but we can give Frodo his
chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us &ndash; keep him blind
to all else that moves.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;A diversion,&rdquo;
I summarised, seeing now where his thoughts had led him.  It seemed
now that he had found his kingdom, he was willing to sacrifice it in
order to save the world as a whole.  I did not envy him the decision,
but I was prepared, as always, to support and follow him to the very
end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli, too, was not
dissuaded.  &ldquo;Certainty of death, small chance of success.  What
are we waiting for?&rdquo;  His tone was sarcastic, but I knew he,
too, would follow where Aragorn led. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf was yet to be
swayed.  &ldquo;Sauron will suspect a trap.  He will not take the
bait.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Oh, I think he
will,&rdquo; Aragorn said, his face set in grim lines.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Without another word,
he strode through an opening into the inner sanctum of the citadel. 
The others exchanged uncertain glances, but I followed Aragorn,
stopping in the doorway to see him uncovering a Palantir.  It blazed
with an inner light and he flinched away from it momentarily.  I
could see him steel himself for a confrontation, his back tensing. 
Then he seized the Palantir and held it up, looking straight into its
depths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Long have you
hunted me,&rdquo; Aragorn announced to his enemy.  &ldquo;Long have I
eluded you.  No more.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With that, he brought
up his newly forged sword and presented it to whatever or whoever
looked out from the other side of the connected Palantirs.  Aragorn
stood motionless for a long moment, his entire body betraying the
strain of whatever mental struggle was taking place.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>This was
the future king of Gondor in full force, meeting his enemy head on
and showing no fear.  But suddenly, he faltered, lowering the sword
haltingly, his shoulders slumped.  The Palantir dropped from his hand
back onto the platform and he covered it quickly with a shudder. 
When he turned, his expression was haunted, anxiety etched into his
face.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>I closed
the distance between us rapidly.  &ldquo;What is it?  What did you
see?&rdquo; I asked him.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Aragorn
looked up at me wearily.  &ldquo;The enemy is coming,&rdquo; he
replied.  &ldquo;He looked into my mind and attacked me where I am
most vulnerable.  He showed me Arwen.  She&rsquo;s dying, Legolas! 
And I&rsquo;m so far away from her.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>I took
hold of his upper arms, grounding him and pulling him away from his
vision.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>Arwen
is strong,&rdquo; I told him.  &ldquo;She may have given up

this is all over, you will be together at last.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>But sudden
despair still clouded Aragorn&rsquo;s mind, blocking him from the
determination he had demonstrated only moments before.  &ldquo;We
have defeated his armies twice, yet Sauron still threatens us.  Will
this ever be over?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>My
unshakable faith in him allowed me to answer with certainty.  &ldquo;Yes.
 We have won victory over seemingly impossible odds on two separate
occasions now.  We will defeat Sauron and you will rule over Gondor
in justice and peace.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Renewed
determination flashed in Aragorn&rsquo;s eyes and he spoke firmly. 
&ldquo;I am ready now to accept that destiny,&rdquo; he said, but
then deflated again.  &ldquo;But it is hard sometimes to be strong
all the time.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>In
response, I pulled him into my embrace and held him to me.  &ldquo;I
remember a young boy who cried in frustration because he could not
run as fast as a certain elven princeling,&rdquo; I murmured in his
ear.  &ldquo;And I remember a youth who wrote dreadful love poetry
after laying eyes on Elrond&rsquo;s daughter for the first time.&rdquo;
 I pushed him back to arm&rsquo;s length and caught his gaze.  &ldquo;You
do not have to be strong with me.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Aragorn
searched my face with troubled eyes.  &ldquo;Why do you follow me,

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>Because
I would not be parted from you,&rdquo; I told him, echoing Eowyn&rsquo;s
words at Helm&rsquo;s Deep, the pain of honesty constricting around
my heart, the time to speak plainly finally upon me after so long. 
&ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Aragorn
reached up and traced a finger down my cheek, his touch leaving a

sorrow.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>I

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>I took his

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>I smiled
then, touched by his open affection.  &ldquo;I know.  Now, I think we

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>We both
took a moment to compose ourselves, then I followed him back out into
the main room where the others still waited.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3>We

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Since I had little
preparation to do and no men to muster, I went back to the Houses of
Healing to check on the wounded.  Eowyn was sleeping, her expression
peaceful, but I found the two hobbits causing quite a ruckus.  They
appeared to be having a pillow fight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Legolas!&rdquo;
Pippin cried as soon as he spotted me.  &ldquo;It's so good to see
you!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;As it is to see
you,&rdquo; I replied wholeheartedly, smiling at his animation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry was just as
enthusiastic in his greeting, bounding up from his bed to greet me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was at this point
that one of the healing attendants approached.  &ldquo;Can you please
take these two out of here?  They're disturbing the other patients,
and there's really nothing wrong with either one of them.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Truly?&rdquo; I
queried.  &ldquo;Merry is quite recovered?  That is good news
indeed.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo;
she replied.  &ldquo;But if he and his friend stay here, they may
well suffer further injury at my hand.  So, please, take them away.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I laughed and turned
back to the hobbits.  &ldquo;You heard the lady.  You've outstayed
your welcome here.  Come along with me, and we'll see if we can find
more appropriate rooms for you.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">They followed me out of
the Houses of Healing meekly enough, but burst into frenzied
questions as soon as we got out into the corridor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What's going
on?&rdquo; Pippin demanded.  &ldquo;Have you heard anything of Frodo
or Sam?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Is the fighting
really over now?&rdquo; Merry wanted to know.  &ldquo;Have we won
yet?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I held up my hands to
silence them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo;
I replied seriously.  &ldquo;In fact, we are marching on the Black
Gate within the hour in order to provide a distraction.  Aragorn
believes it will allow Frodo and Sam to reach Mount Doom and end this
once and for all.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I knew as soon as the
words left my lips that I should never have spoken them.  Indeed, the
hobbits immediately demanded to be part of the diversionary
expedition.  I tried to reason with them but they were adamant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Frodo and Sam
are our friends,&rdquo; Merry pointed out.  &ldquo;We've come this
far &ndash; we have to follow this through.  We can't be left behind
at the end.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Just last night,
you were lying at death's door,&rdquo; I reminded him.  &ldquo;Do you
really want to go straight back out into battle?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry sobered, the
light in his eyes dimming as he recalled his experiences of the day
before.  &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he asked me solemnly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I was reminded of my
thoughts of earlier that morning, of how much I hated the changes
that had been wrought in me over the many months I had been a part of
this war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo;
I said quietly.  &ldquo;But it must be done if we are ever to come
out from under Sauron's shadow.  I am well aware that I may not live
out this day, but I am prepared to make that sacrifice to safeguard
Middle Earth.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;As are we,&rdquo;
Pippin stated firmly, Merry nodding beside him.  &ldquo;Don't stop us
from doing our part.  We've both proved now that we can fight, and it
sounds like every sword will count.  We want to come too.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Much as I wanted to
protect them, I could not argue with them on this point.  They were
right; they deserved the opportunity to see this through to its
conclusion.  I would not be able to remain behind if it were my
childhood friends out on the other side of that wall, so how could I
deny them the chance to offer their assistance?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I waited while they
found and put on their armour, marvelling at how much they looked
like seasoned soldiers when they were finished.  Pippin stood in his
uniform of black and silver, the White Tree of Gondor shining on his
chest, while Merry looked determined in the green and yellow of
Rohan, two miniature warriors girding themselves for battle.  My
heart constricted as I looked at them, but I could not fault their
determination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I led them to the
assembly point outside the city.  Glances of surprise and disapproval
were thrown my way by Gimli and Gandalf as we approached, but I
stared them both down and neither said a word as the hobbits
presented themselves to join our party.  Gandalf pulled Pippin up
behind him on Shadowfax, while Eomer knelt before Merry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I am sorry I
doubted you, Meriadoc Brandybuck,&rdquo; he said formally, &ldquo;and
I can never repay the debt I owe you for your protection of my
sister.  Tell me what service I may do you, and I will do it.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Take me into
battle with you,&rdquo; Merry replied immediately with equal
seriousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I would be
honoured to have you at my back,&rdquo; Eomer said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He swung into his
saddle and pulled Merry up behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli had magicked up
Arod from somewhere, so we once again rode together among our
friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn was resplendent
in a Gondorian tunic, boldly declaring his allegiance to the city and
taking claim of his authority over the army.  The troops formed up
behind him and he led us away from the city and towards the dark
place on the horizon where all our fates would be decided.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We rode slowly, not
wishing to outpace the infantry soldiers behind us, but we still
arrived at the Black Gates of Mordor far sooner than I would have
thought possible.  My heart hammered in my chest at being so close to
Sauron's lair and I wondered, not for the first time, if I would ever
leave this place.  Gimli's solid presence at my back reassured me and
I knew we would fight and die together if that was what the day held
in store for us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The army halted a
little way away from the gate itself, and I could feel the awe and
fear of the soldiers as they looked up at its forbidding menace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn took his horse
out in front and called out a challenge.  &ldquo;Let the Lord of the
Black Land come forth!  Let justice be done upon him!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A moment later, the
gate opened a few feet and a single figure on a horse emerged.  It
was swathed in a long black cloak and had a massive helmet that
covered the majority of its face.  Its mouth, however, remained in
view and it grinned across the distance between us, revealing
hideous, yellowed teeth.  When it spoke, its voice was oily and sent
shudders down my spine, as if I had suddenly been covered in thick,
black tar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;My master,
Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome,&rdquo; it said.  &ldquo;Is there
any in this rout with authority to treat with me?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf spoke up on our
behalf.  &ldquo;We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and
accursed.  Tell your master this: the armies of Mordor must disband. 
He is to depart these lands, never to return.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I do not know what
response Gandalf expected to this pronouncement, but it did not
surprise me when the creature grinned again, apparently completely
unaffected by the wizard's demands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Aha, Old
Greybeard.  I have a token I was bidden to show thee,&rdquo; it said,
pulling something out from under its cloak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I instantly recognised
the mithril shirt Frodo had been wearing when he was stabbed by the
cave troll under Moria.  It seemed like years had passed since that
encounter, back when we were all still together, before we had lost
Boromir and been separated from Frodo and Sam.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I heard Pippin whisper
Frodo's name despairingly, as the creature at the gate threw the
shirt to Gandalf, who snatched it out of the air and clutched it to
him almost as if it were actually Frodo's body and not just a
garment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The evil creature
laughed, but Gandalf shouted, &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry cried out in
denial of what the shirt represented, but Gandalf called for silence
once more and the hobbit grew still.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The halfling was
dear to thee, I see,&rdquo; the creature continued, taunting us. 
&ldquo;Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.  Who
would have thought one so small could endure so much pain?  And he
did, Gandalf.  He did.&rdquo;  It chuckled at its own words and I
itched to have my hands around its neck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf passed the
shirt to Pippin, whose face betrayed his horror and sorrow at this
discussion of his friend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn, meanwhile,
spurred his horse forward to confront the creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;And who is
this?&rdquo; it asked contemptuously.  &ldquo;Isildur's heir?  It
takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Before it could say
another word, Aragorn brandished that very blade and lopped its head
off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I guess that
concludes negotiations,&rdquo; Gimli said wryly from behind me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn turned back to
his troops.  &ldquo;I do not believe it.  I will not,&rdquo; he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Behind him, the gates
opened once more, this time not stopping but swinging wide.  I heard
the shouts of orcs emanating from within the walls, and suddenly they
began to swarm out onto the plain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Fall back!  Fall
back!&rdquo; Aragorn cried, and we all rode back to rejoin the
soldiers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn rode along the
front line.  &ldquo;Hold your ground!&rdquo; he called out.  &ldquo;Hold
your ground!  Sons of Gondor, of Rohan!  My brothers!  I see in your
eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me!  A day may come
when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break
all bonds of fellowship.  But it is not this day.  An hour of wolves
and shattered shields, when the age of men comes crashing down.  But
it is not this day!  This day we fight!  By all that you hold dear on
this good earth.  I bid you stand, Men of the West!&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I felt my heart rise to
meet his passion and I marvelled at his leadership, which might just
hold us together long enough to allow Frodo the time he needed to
finish his quest.  All the solders drew their weapons and held
themselves at the ready to meet the enemy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We watched as the orcs
streamed out from the gates and started to circle around us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Quickly!&rdquo;
Aragorn called to those of us on horses.  &ldquo;Dismount and send
the horses back towards the city.  We will not be able to use them at
such close quarters, without risking our own men.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We followed his
instructions and joined the soldiers on the ground.  The horses
galloped away as if their tails were on fire, surely knowing they
were escaping certain death.  The orcs quickly surrounded us
completely, but kept their distance at first, corralling us and
taunting us but not yet attacking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gimli stood beside me,
his axe in his hand.  &ldquo;Never thought I'd die fighting side by
side with an elf,&rdquo; he joked, harking back to our first meeting
and its near disastrous animosity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What about side
by side with a friend?&rdquo; I countered, not wanting to start this
battle with flippancy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Aye, I could do
that,&rdquo; he replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was at the moment,
surrounded by orcs and facing almost certain death, that a
realisation came to me.  I had been wasting my life in the hopes of
achieving something that would never come to be.  I knew in my heart
of hearts that Aragorn would never be mine, and I had thought I was
satisfied with loving him from afar and accepting the friendship that
was all he could give.  But I was fooling myself and not paying
attention to what was happening around me.  My selfish, self-pitying
feelings were so unimportant and so ridiculous when compared to the
bond that had been forged between myself and those who stood around
me; a wizard I would forever look up to with awe and affection, two
young hobbits who had stolen their way into my heart when I wasn't
looking, and a grumbling dwarf who had become as dear to me as my own
family back in Mirkwood.  These were real feelings, emotions that had
meaning in the midst of this struggle, bonds that would be with me
for the rest of my life, be that many years or merely minutes.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I looked across at
Aragorn, standing ready at the head of his troops, and it struck me
that the ideal of him that I loved was not a real person, but merely
something I had constructed out of adolescent fancy and boyish
dreams.  The Aragorn who stood on that field ready to face his
enemies once again was not a perfect creature of pure romantic love;
he was a man, with weaknesses that would need to be bolstered by my
support.  He did not need my love, he needed my loyalty and my
strength to help him through the trial we faced together.  The same
was true of those dear friends who stood with us, and I knew each of
them would do the same for me.  This was real, this was important and
it deserved my undivided focus.  I would dream no more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Meanwhile, we were at a
stand-off with the orc army.  They shrieked and gestured at us but
made no move to attack.  I wondered what they were waiting for, but
didn't have a chance to find out when they would have broken the
uneasy inactivity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn turned to look
over his shoulder at us and said, &ldquo;For Frodo.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With that, he
brandished his sword and started running towards the orcs.  Merry and
Pippin immediately ran after him, yelling at the tops of their lungs,
with myself and Gimli right behind them.  I heard the soldiers
joining the charge and then we were upon the enemy, smashing through
their line and beginning the battle on our terms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">And so I found myself
knee-deep in orcs for the second time in as many days, this time
without supernatural allies to help.  I couldn't help thinking Gimli
had had the right idea the day before; we should have kept the ghost
army available to us as long as possible.  Aragorn would never have
stood for that, though.  So, for better or worse, we were on our own
this time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I tried to keep an eye
on my friends, particularly the hobbits, but it was impossible in the
crush of the battle.  The orcs were literally all around us, and it
was a struggle just to remain upright, most of the time, let alone
watch out for the tiny figures of Merry and Pippin.  I would have to
just trust that their luck would hold for one more fight.  Gimli
started out at my side, but we were soon separated, and I lost sight
of Gandalf's whirling staff early on, as well.  I wasn't counting
victims this time; I needed all my concentration to stay alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the Nazgul arrived
on their flying monsters, I thought it was all over.  I heard the
screeching overhead and felt a wave of fear and despair wash through
the men around me.  I didn't need to look up to know they were there,
which was a good thing, since taking my eye off my opponent would
surely have resulted in my death.  I just waited in dread to feel
teeth or claws in the back of my neck; I figured it was only a matter
of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, a familiar
voice lifted my heart, not only because of the words it spoke, but
also because it confirmed that at least one of my friends was still
alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Eagles!  The
eagles are coming!&rdquo;  Pippin's cry rose up above the noise of
the battle, and my eyes were inevitably drawn upwards to see our
giant winged allies join the fray against the Nazgul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Safe in the knowledge
now that death would not come from above, I wrenched my attention
back to the ground just in time to avoid a sword thrust from an orc,
and continued the endless battle.  Some time later, I was aware in
the periphery of my vision that the Nazgul were retreating, and I
heard a ragged cheer go up from my comrades.  We needed every morale
boost we could get at that point, so it was a very welcome sight
indeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Another familiar cry
caught my attention and this time it was not so heartening.  I looked
across the battlefield to see Aragorn struggling against an enormous
troll.  As I watched, the creature landed a blow that sent Aragorn
flying and then it advanced on his motionless form, evidently
preparing to finish the job.  I started running towards them,
stabbing orcs out of my way as I went, but I knew I would never get
there in time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The troll bore down on
Aragorn and raised its mighty club to crush him, but Aragorn managed
to bring his knife round to stab it before it could complete its
swing.  I was still several feet away, when I felt a wave of shock
and anger sweep through me from an unknown source.  I staggered at
the intensity of the emotion, and my eyes blurred for a moment.  When
my vision cleared, I looked up to see that all of Sauron's forces had
stopped fighting.  As I looked on in surprise, the troll who had been
battling Aragorn suddenly looked back towards Mordor and started
running from the battlefield.  All of its comrades followed suit,
abandoning the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I closed the distance
to Aragorn and helped him to his feet, checking as I did so that he
was unhurt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, my eyes were
drawn to the tower of Barad-Dur and the great Eye atop it, which
seemed to be disoriented, spinning its gaze without coherence. 
Everyone's eyes were fixed on it as its light dimmed and the tower
started to crumble.  As the stone toppled, the Eye gradually shrank
in size until it was completely distinguished.  At the moment it
disappeared, a ring of light burst from its source, sending an
accompanying shock wave sweeping over the fleeing army.  The land
around the Black Gate began to collapse in on itself, taking the gate
and many of the orcs and trolls with it.  They screamed as they fell
into the abyss opening up beneath their feet, and I feared we would
all suffer the same fate.  However, the destruction halted just shy
of where our troops were milling around in confusion, leaving us
still on solid ground.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I caught sight of
Merry's grinning face in the throng.  &ldquo;Frodo!  Frodo!&rdquo; he
cried in triumph, surmising as I had that the young hobbit had at
last managed to cast the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom.  As if to
corroborate Merry's thought, the mountain itself suddenly exploded,
expelling lava and rock into the sky.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Pippin repeated Merry's
call of Frodo's name but, this time, he was crying.  If Frodo had
been in the mountain when it erupted, it was unlikely he would have
survived.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf, however, was
not ready to give up.  He crossed to where the eagles had landed a
short distance away and climbed up onto one feathery back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;If they are
alive, we will find them,&rdquo; he called to us and, in moments, the
eagles had taken flight and were winging their way towards the
mountain.  We waited, unable to voice our fears or acknowledge our
hopes, our eyes on the the sky as the eagles shrank to specks.  I
clutched at Aragorn's arm and his answering grip told me his anxiety
matched my own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">At long last, I saw the
eagles returning and struggled to make out what it was that they
carried in their claws.  Eventually, the tiny forms of Sam and Frodo
came into focus, and I saw Gandalf waving from atop the lead eagle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I looked around,
grinning, but then realised that no-one else could yet make out the
returning eagles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;The eagles have
Frodo and Sam!&rdquo; I called out.  &ldquo;Gandalf is waving so they
must still be alive.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A huge cheer went up as
the eagles flew overhead, aiming for Minas Tirith and safety at long
last for those two heroic hobbits.  I was nearly knocked from my feet
by Merry and Pippin hurtling to embrace me and then each other, and I
looked round to see Aragorn grinning at my side.  A hand on my arm
brought my attention down to Gimli, who was standing at my side with
tears in his eyes.  I almost started crying myself with the knowledge
that all my friends were safe and whole, and that the battle was
finally over, once and for all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Together, we started on
our weary way back towards the city to be reunited with the saviours
of Middle Earth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">* * * * *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When we reached Minas
Tirith and climbed our way up to the citadel, Gandalf met us at the
main entrance.  He forestalled the questions of Merry and Pippin
before they could even open their mouths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Frodo and Sam
are both alive and safe.  Your friends are back with us at last. 
Come, I will take you to them.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn touched
Gandalf's arm.  &ldquo;Do they need my help?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;No, they just
need rest and the love of their friends,&rdquo; the wizard reassured
him.  &ldquo;You go and rest, too.  I think you've done your part for
today.  The hobbits will still be there for you to fuss over in the
morning.&rdquo;  He gave Aragorn a fatherly smile and went inside. 
Merry, Pippin and Gimli followed him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn looked about
ready to collapse.  I took his arm and led him inside, finding his
room more by luck than memory.  Once inside, he turned to me, a whole
range of emotions etched onto his face.  It looked as though he
didn't know whether to feel happy or sad at the situation we now
found ourselves in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He sank down onto the
bed and looked up at me, his eyes lost and searching for reassurance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Is it really
over, Legolas?&rdquo; he asked me.  &ldquo;Really and truly, have we
defeated Sauron at long last?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo;
I told him softly.  &ldquo;We really have.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As if he had needed
someone else to say the words out loud for him to believe it,
Aragorn's face crumpled and he dissolved into helpless tears, finally
allowing himself to let go of the tension he must have been holding
inside all this time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I crossed to the bed
and sat down next to him, taking him in my arms and holding him to my
chest as he cried.  I felt him shudder against me and felt nothing
more than compassion for the sense of responsibility he must have
felt so strongly since the very beginning of our journey together,
and even before.  This was a truly great man I held in my arms and I
felt privileged that he was comfortable enough in my company to
reveal to me his human weakness and true feelings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I let him cry, rocking
him gently and whispering words of comfort in Elvish.  Eventually,
his tears ceased and he sat up, his gaze dropping to his hands as if
he was ashamed to look at me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What kind of
behaviour is this for the heir to Gondor?&rdquo; he said softly,
half-smiling at himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I laid my hand on his
shoulder, and he raised his eyes to meet mine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;I told you
before, that is not who you are to me,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;Even
kings need to shed their crowns at times, and I am glad to be a
friend you can turn to in such times of need.  Promise me you will
never let titles or decorum come between us.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He smiled.  &ldquo;I
believe that is a promise I can keep,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Thank
you, Legolas.  You have no idea how much your friendship means to
me.&rdquo;  His face grew serious again.  &ldquo;But what about you? 
I can offer you the same, but I know that is not what you want from
me.  How can that be fair?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;It is now all I
want from you,&rdquo; I told him honestly.  &ldquo;And I will accept
your unconditional friendship gladly.  Elven princelings sometimes
need to shed their reserve as well.&rdquo;  He smiled at my
flippancy.  &ldquo;You do not need to worry about my heart.  It is
whole and healthy, and just realising there are many things in my
life that need a share in its attention.  I will not be pining away,
never fear.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Before he could answer
that, I rose and continued lightly.  &ldquo;Now it is time for us
both to get some sleep.  There are going to be four hobbits running
around here tomorrow, so we're going to need our energy.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">That raised a laugh. 
&ldquo;Goodnight, Legolas.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Goodnight,
Aragorn.&rdquo;</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The following morning,
I found out from one of the servants where Frodo and Sam had been
taken, and made my way towards their rooms.  On the way, I inevitably
came across Merry, Pippin, Gimli and Aragorn, also on their way to
visit with our long-lost friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;They were both
asleep when we stopped by last night,&rdquo; Gimli told me, &ldquo;but
Gandalf said they should both be up and about today.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As if summoned by his
words, a door opened nearby and Sam emerged into the corridor.  Merry
and Pippin flung themselves at him and enveloped him in a three-way
hug.  He looked a little startled at first, but submitted to their
attentions with a quiet smile on his face.  He greeted the rest of us
as well, and I saw a great weariness in his eyes as they met mine.  I
looked back at him, trying to convey my appreciation of what he had
done and my understanding that he was no longer the same hobbit I had
parted from in the wilderness.  He held my gaze for a long moment,
and then nodded, as if accepting my tacit support.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Merry and Pippin
released him and then raced ahead and into a different room.  There
were exclamations of joy, and the rest of us followed more slowly, to
see the two young hobbits bouncing on a huge bed, which also
contained Frodo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The hero of the hour
was sitting up in bed, smiling down at his cousins as they rejoiced
in their reunion.  Like Sam, he seemed somehow apart from them, a
shadow across his face, which told of his many trials.  He called out
our names as he noticed us in the doorway, and seemed happy to see
us, but I sensed there were many things he yet had to recover from. 
He was not the same, either, and I didn't think he ever would be. 
When Sam eventually crossed the threshold, a look passed between them
that told me nobody else would ever understand what they had been
through together.  I was glad they had each other, though.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf had already
been seated in the room when we arrived, and so it was that the eight
remaining members of our fellowship came together again at long last.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">* * * * * 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We all spent a few days
simply coming to terms with the fact that we did not have to journey
elsewhere to carry on the fight.  The citizens of Minas Tirith worked
hard to clear the debris of the battle, both masonry and casualties,
and to move on with their lives.  Aragorn leaped straight into his
new role as leader of the city, organising the clearing crews and
going out into the streets himself to help.  Gimli and I joined them,
too, when we weren't spending time with the hobbits.  Frodo gained
strength daily, but still remained slightly remote.  Merry and Pippin
didn't seem to notice, being boisterous enough for four hobbits just
on their own, but I saw Sam looking at Frodo with sorrow in his eyes
more than once.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One afternoon, I was
standing at the far end of the promontory at the top of the city,
looking out across the plains to where the sky was gradually clearing
over Mordor.  What once had been a blight on both my vision and my
soul was now the most reassuring view available to me, confirming as
it did that Sauron was really gone.  I heard footsteps behind me and
turned to find Sam approaching.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo;
I said in welcome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He said nothing as he
joined me at the wall, looking out at Mordor as I had been a moment
before.  I waited, sure he would speak when he was ready, or willing
just to share the view with him in silence if that was his
preference.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He did speak after a
few minutes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;What do you
feel?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, his voice solemn and so quiet I had
to strain to hear him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I took a moment to
consider the question, trying to fathom what he was asking me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eventually, I found
some words to respond.  &ldquo;I feel sorrow at the suffering I have
seen, and relief that it is now at an end.  I feel determination to
help rebuild Middle Earth so that it can be what it once was.  I feel
anger and shame at the things I have been forced to do and endure.  I
feel regret for all the things I could not prevent, and for all the
things my friends suffered without me there to help them.  Most of
all, I feel sad that I cannot just go back to being who I was &ndash;
carefree and innocent of all this.  Soon, I will go home and carry on
with my life, but I will never again be the same, and I feel fear
that nobody there will understand that.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">As my speech came to a
close, I looked down to see tears falling on Sam's cheeks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">He still did not look
at me, but his choked reply reached my ears all the same.  &ldquo;That
is what I feel, too.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;So, now you know
that there others who will understand, even if those at home do not. 
I believe that, no matter how far we may be separated, we will always
be there for each other.  This journey we have faced will bind us
together forever.&rdquo;  I laid a hand on his shoulder and he
finally looked up at me.  &ldquo;The rest of us will never know all
that you and Frodo went through on your part of the quest, and I know
he will need you to support and comfort him for a long time to come. 
You are his anchor, the only one who has any chance of understanding
his suffering.  But that does not mean you cannot look for comfort of
your own.  Know that you can always send a message to Mirkwood and I
will come to you.&rdquo;</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
Sam said, his voice barely above a whisper.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then he turned back to
the view and we stood there together, looking out over the field of
our final victory, until the descending sun sent us back inside for
warmth and more lively companionship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">* * * * *</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A few days later, the
same space Sam and I had shared was packed with people present for
Aragorn's coronation.  He had requested that the ceremony be as short
and informal as possible, as always not wanting all the attention to
rest on him.  Gandalf and Gimli stood on the citadel steps with him,
an honour I had declined but refused to tell him why.  I had another
place in the ceremony that I hoped would act as the pleasantest
surprise of the day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The coronation itself
consisted simply of Gandalf placing the winged Gondorian crown on
Aragorn's head.  He then stood back to reveal the new king to his
people.  Aragorn had let his beard grow out and now it added
distinction to his face.  He was dressed in full kingly regalia and
looked magnificent, gazing out over the crowd.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gandalf announced, &ldquo;Now
come the days of the king.  May they be blessed.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn himself turned
away and made his way to the very top of the steps, turning once more
to address his subjects.  There was a great cheer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;This day does
not belong to one man,&rdquo; he said in his usual self-deprecating
way, &ldquo;but to all.  Let us together rebuild this world, that we
may share in the days of peace.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Cheering erupted once
more, as flower petals descended from the white tower to cover the
crowd.  Aragorn descended the steps once more and went out into the
crowd to meet his people.  I watched him move among them and rejoiced
that he had at last found a place in the world where he could do good
and be appreciated fully by those around him.  I knew without a doubt
that he would make a good king.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Eowyn was near the
front of the crowd and one of the first to present herself to the
newly crowned king.  By her side stood Faramir, the steward of the
city, whom I had met the day after the last battle.  I smiled to see
them so happy with each other, and it made me glad to know that Eowyn
had found love.  I felt a kinship to her and wished her well in her
new life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Shortly afterwards,
Aragorn approached where I was standing with the other elves who had
made the trip to witness the coronation.  He stopped in front of me
and pulled me into a joyous embrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
he said in Elvish, and I knew he meant for more than just my presence
there that day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I had one more thing to
give him.  Smiling, I stepped to one side to reveal Elrond and Arwen
standing behind me.  The look on Aragorn's face as he laid eyes on
his beloved was worth a thousand thanks.  I don't think I have ever
been so happy as I was in that moment when I reunited them after so
long a separation.  Aragorn looked back at me and I knew he saw only
happiness in my face, no regret shadowing my joy.  He smiled his
gratitude and then turned back to Arwen.  She stepped forward,
carrying a banner which portrayed the White Tree of Gondor,
symbolising her commitment to him in his new role as king.  He raised
her chin and looked deep into her eyes, neither of them speaking or
moving.  Then, suddenly, he swept her into his arms and kissed her
hard, taking her by surprise and delighting the surrounding crowd,
who burst once more into cheers and applause.  Elrond also smiled,
finally accepting his daughter's choice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Aragorn and Arwen
proceeded through the crowd together, with the rest of us following
behind.  They came to a halt before a line of four hobbits, who all
bowed together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;My friends!&rdquo;
Aragorn called to forestall them.  &ldquo;You bow to no-one.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With that, he knelt
before them, Arwen joining him and the rest of the crowd gradually
following suit.  The hobbits looked distinctly uncomfortable at this
show of appreciation, but they deserved it after all they had done
for us.  I felt privileged to call them my friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">After that, <SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#000000">the
crowd dissipated and Aragorn led Arwen, the hobbits, Elrond, Gandalf,
Gimli, Eowyn, Faramir, Eomer and myself inside the citadel to join
him for dinner.  This was a lighthearted affair after the solemnity
of the ceremony outside, but an event tinged with sadness.  I knew
that this was the last time all of us would be together like this
and, despite all the suffering we had endured, it made me sad in a
way to think that our journey had finally come to its conclusion.  We
had battled evil and won, and now we would depart to our homes.  It
seemed almost an anti-climax and also a miracle that we still had
homes to go to.  I looked around at the beloved faces sharing the
table with me, and suddenly I knew that this was not the end, but in
fact the beginning of a new chapter in all our lives.  I wondered
what fate had in store for each of us now, and I looked forward to
finding out.</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
