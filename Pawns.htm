<I><P>Planets turn, continents shift, across the face of Middle Earth events are building towards a terrible climax.  The fate of an entire world is being played out on a vast field before a beseiged city.  Two armies clash, and few will leave this place of conflict unmarked.</P>

<P>Horses wheel beneath the massive legs of oliphaunts that attempt to crush them as they pass by.  All around them, the catapults of the attackers hurl enormous boulders to shatter the city’s battlements.  On the field, one leader calls his soldiers to him before a winged shadow swoops down to deliver him a mortal blow, while, at the top of the city, another leader prepares his own doom, directing his men to build a funeral pyre for himself and his injured son.</P>

<P>Our focus shrinks further to pinpoint two tiny figures, one lying all alone on the battlefield after fighting to defend his king, the other watching his liege lord’s madness in horror.  Everything is so big and they are so small, but they each have a part to play as the pieces move across the gameboard of their lives.</P>

<P>Merry came back to awareness slowly.  The sounds of metal striking metal, and the screams of the dying, reached his befuddled ears as he struggled to remember where he was.  His armour was digging into his neck as he lay awkwardly on the hard ground.  His armour?  Suddenly, it all came rushing back – the battle, the charge of the Rohirrim, he and Eowyn riding against the oliphaunts.  Eowyn; where was Eowyn?  Anxiety gave him a surge of strength and he forced himself up onto his elbows, scanning his surroundings.  There were bodies everywhere, littering the ground in all directions, and the fighting continued somewhere off to his left, but Merry ignored all that in his concern for the fair maiden who had allowed him to ride with him into battle.</P>

<P>Something large and black blocked the view in front of him, and it took Merry a moment to realise that it was the body of a Nazgul’s steed.  It lay unmoving, and Merry could just see the bloody end of its mutilated neck, attesting to its demise.  But where was its rider?  Merry pulled himself forwards, not wanting to announce his presence to any enemies in the vicinity by standing up.  He edged round the monster’s corpse and the scene that came into view made his breath catch in his throat.</P>

<P>Eowyn was standing before the fallen horse of Rohan’s king, defending Theoden against the Witch King himself, a towering figure in spiked black armour, wielding a gigantic mace.  Merry watched in horror as the massive weapon was brought to bear against Eowyn, battering at her shield and driving her to the ground.  She cried out at the impact, and Merry knew she had no chance against such an opponent.</P>

<P>Echoing his thoughts, the Witch King uttered a chilling laugh, and sneered, &quot;No man can kill me.&quot;</P>

<P>But maybe the combined efforts of a hobbit and a shieldmaiden could, Merry thought.  Screwing up his courage, he crawled forwards, approaching unseen from behind the evil creature.  Gripping his small sword tightly in one hand, he brought it up and plunged it into the back of the Ring Wraith’s leg with all his strength.</P>

<P>Pain exploded in Merry’s arm as he delivered the blow, agony such as he had never imagined, that drove all thoughts of Eowyn and the battle from his mind.  He rolled away from the Witch King, clutching his arm to his chest, but the pain only intensified.  On the heels of the pain came a wave of intense cold that travelled up his arm and across his heart, where it settled like a shadow.  Suddenly, it was difficult to breathe, and Merry felt himself slipping into darkness.  On the edge of his awareness, he heard a terrible screeching cry, and then he knew no more.</P>

<P>On the gameboard of Pelennor, a pawn had fallen.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The hall stretched out before Pippin, a seemingly endless distance between him and events taking place at the other end.  Faramir lay atop a platform, surrounded by sticks.  His father stood to one side, his face twisted in a grimace of madness.  Pippin heard Gandalf call out to Denethor to stop, but he didn’t wait to see the steward’s reaction; he was already running.  He had sworn his allegiance to the steward of the city, but he considered himself released from those vows the moment Denethor had lost touch with reality.  Now all that mattered was that Faramir be saved from a premature death at the hands of his father.</P>

<P>Gandalf was at his side as he sped down the hall towards the makeshift pyre, so Pippin ignored Denethor, focusing entirely on the immobile form of Faramir, knowing that the wizard would take care of the other man.  But they were too late.  As he ran, Pippin saw Denethor raise a burning torch and drop it onto the pyre, setting light to the platform.  Pippin didn’t stop; he wasn’t prepared to let Boromir’s brother die while he stood by and watched.  With a cry borne out of combined terror and determination, he launched himself through the burgeoning flames and landed next to Faramir on the pyre.</P>

<P>Waves of heat rose around him and he fought off the panic that threatened to choke him along with the smoke.  Pippin grabbed the edges of Faramir’s tunic, summoned up all his strength and rolled off the edge of the platform, pulling Faramir with him.  He felt a blast of heat envelop him and then suddenly he was falling through cool, clear air.  Before he had a chance to register his success, he hit the ground, the unconscious man landing on top of him and knocking all the breath from his body.  Everything dimmed for a moment, but Pippin knew Faramir was safe.</P>

<P>Up in the city, a pawn had triumphed.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<I><P>The battle is over, the attackers routed by the arrival of a supernatural ally with the returning king.  Out on the field, two tiny figures are reunited.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!  It’s me, Pippin!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I knew you’d find me.&quot;</P>

<P>Together again at last, the brave pawns have proven their worth, and soon they will be knights.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
