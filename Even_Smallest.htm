<P>Aragorn peered up at the darkening sky anxiously. "I don't like the look of those clouds. Come on, everyone. We'd better try to find some shelter."</P>

<P>As the group followed Aragorn’s suggestion, Merry found himself grateful for the approaching bad weather.  The pace had been hard since they had left Rivendell, and he was struggling to keep up with the men, who had much longer strides and gave little quarter to the smaller hobbits.  Merry didn’t want to confirm the opinion of those who had argued against him making up one of the party, so he forbore from complaint, battling on over the rough terrain.</P>

<P>Soon, though, he sank down inside the cave Aragorn had found, with a barely repressed sigh, Pippin beside him.  In the dim light, Pippin’s face was not clear but Merry felt his friend’s hand seek out and clutch his own, communicating tacit support and commiseration.</P>

<P>&quot;What are we doing here, Merry?&quot; came Pippin’s uncertain voice.</P>

<P>&quot;Helping Frodo,&quot; Merry whispered back.</P>

<P>&quot;How?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don’t know yet,&quot; Merry admitted, but he was determined not to be useless baggage on this trip.  &quot;We’ll find a way, you’ll see.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin wasn’t convinced.  He squeezed Merry’s fingers more tightly and murmured, &quot;But this whole thing is so big and we’re so small.  What can we do to make a difference?&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<I><P>&quot;Maybe Treebeard’s right.  We don’t belong here, Merry.  This is too big for us.  What can we do in the end?  We’ve got the Shire.  Maybe we should go home.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The fires of Isengard will spread.  The woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.  And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone!  There won’t be a Shire, Pippin.&quot;</P>

<P>In the course of the Entmoot, Merry had brought to bear all the passion and forcefulness in his being in an attempt to persuade the Ents to join their cause.  Finally, he had thought, this was his opportunity to do something important, to contribute to the war his friends were all out there fighting.  But nothing he had said had even dented the insularity of the Ents.  He had stood in that clearing under darkening skies and faced down a giant tree creature, pouring his heart into his argument, and his effect had been precisely nothing.</P>

<P>Treebeard wasn’t right – but maybe Pippin had been, back in the cave all that time ago.  Maybe they were too small to help out in the big world.  Sitting atop Treebeard’s branches on the way out of Fangorn, Merry was completely disheartened.  He had tried his best and failed, but he couldn’t be satisfied with the effort, not when Frodo and Sam were still out there, battling and presumably overcoming far greater obstacles than a bunch of stubborn plant people.</P>

<P>No one had told Frodo he was too small, or that he shouldn’t go.  It was so unfair; Frodo had been forced into bearing the fate of the world, through circumstance and an admirable sense of duty.  Merry actively wanted to contribute but nobody would let him.</P>

<P>By the time Pippin called for Treebeard to stop and take them back the other way, Merry had thought himself into such a dispirited mood that he listened to Pippin’s garbled reasoning with both annoyance and horror.</P>

<P>&quot;Are you mad?!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;We’ll be caught!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, we won’t,&quot; Pippin replied with the utmost certainty.  &quot;Not this time.&quot;</P>

<P>Something in the way he said it sparked the flame in Merry’s heart once again.</P>

<P>&quot;You’re a genius, Pip!&quot; he exclaimed once the devastation of the forest on the borders of Isengard had incited the Ents to march to war.</P>

<P>Pippin grinned at him again and replied, &quot;I know!&quot;</P>

<P>So, while Frodo and Sam made their way through Mordor to face one great evil power, their two friends led the charge against the other, four small hobbits taking on the world.</P>

<P>THE END</P>
