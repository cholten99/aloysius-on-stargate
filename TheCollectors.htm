up with his ears and he realized Jack’s mistake. “Zugzwang,” he repeated in his

through the large window in front of them, Jack could see that the iris was

the transmission monitor. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

location,” Aldwin explained. “We sent a probe through as soon as we worked out
the address and our readings show that there is evidence of a Tok’ra vessel not

stargate again as they went. Behind them, the ground rose steadily and became
the foothills of a mountain range while, ahead, rolling moorland spread out in
gentle slopes with scattered vegetation obscuring the view. The going was quite
hard in the aftermath of the storm but they made good time and it wasn’t long
before Teal’c pointed towards the horizon and announced, “I believe Anise’s
ship lies just ahead.” Daniel squinted forwards and could just make out an
angular shape that stood out from the surrounding greenery. Despite the fact
that they had seen no signs of indigenous life anywhere so far, they approached
the downed ship cautiously, weapons close at<span style='color:red'> </span>hand.
As they drew nearer, it became apparent that the Goa’uld-style cargo vessel had
crash-landed and skidded quite some distance, leaving a long track of upturned

when in space. Once he had opened the inner hatch, it took the four of them
only seconds to check every inch of the compact ship. There was no sign of
Anise, although Sam discovered her archaeological tools in the cargo area along
with a few days’ supplies. SG-1 gathered outside the ship again to assess the

a small river that cut sideways across the land. In the distance, on the far
side, they could see a large network of clearly artificial structures that was
presumably a town of some kind, although it was too far away to see in any
detail. However, what had caught Jack’s attention was a single, much closer
complex, which stood alone on the near side of the river. It was a <span

by cylindrical walkways that were suspended above the ground between them. The
entire building was made of a smooth, non-reflective black material, with no
discernible openings of any kind. The site was surrounded<span

of a similar substance. There was no obvious opening in the fence, either, but

for a closer look. Each of the four pens held a collection of seven or eight

a chicken to that of a sheep and had any number of legs from none to eight.
Some appeared feathered, others were covered in rough fur, while one
particularly ugly specimen was completely hairless. They milled around in their

unlikely things would be that simple. Daniel stopped a couple of feet away from

from the same place. It struck Daniel, who gave a strangled cry and fell to the
ground. As Sam looked on in horror, another beam of light, this one green,

the Colonel could reach him. Jack looked about wildly for a second before
turning round and running back up the hill to where the remaining members of

cold and felt as if he was floating. Then, his instincts snapped him fully
awake and sent him into a blind panic as he realized that he wasn’t breathing.
His brain sent frantic messages to his lungs but his body wouldn’t respond.
Slowly, as time ticked by and he didn’t lose consciousness again, Daniel
realized that he wasn’t about to die, and there was no sense that his body was
fighting for oxygen. He forced himself to calm down and assess his situation
more rationally. His eyes were open but his vision was distorted more than
usual by a thick liquid in which he seemed to be suspended. His mouth was also
open and he could feel that his throat and lungs were full of the liquid but he
couldn’t move any part of his body. He could just about make out a transparent
substance enclosing the liquid a few inches in front of him but he couldn’t
discern any details about what lay beyond. Suddenly, he felt something sharp
press against his side. Pain blossomed throughout his abdomen and darkness

synchronicity born of almost four years working closely together, the two men
readied their weapons and set off down the tunnel. There was no sign that

mixture of fear and relief in her eyes alone spurred Jack into action. He

and struck the tank that enclosed Freya. The glass shattered, releasing the
liquid inside and Freya came tumbling out, landing in the arms of the Jaffa,
who had stepped forward to catch her. She immediately started choking, and
Teal’c supported her while she expelled the liquid from her body. Once the fit
