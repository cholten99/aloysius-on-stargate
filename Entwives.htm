<P>* * *</P>

<P>It was spring in the Shire.  The grass was a luxuriant green and the chimneys that marked the hobbit holes across the landscape slept after their hard winter labour.  This was the time when hobbit children ran amuck in the lanes, finally released by the better weather to burn off all the energy they had stored up in the cold months.  This was also the time when Farmer Maggot planted his crops, ready for some of those same hobbit children to pilfer later in the year.</P>

<P>Or so Merry presumed.  He knew of at least a couple of young Tooks and Brandybucks who had the same reputation for mischief-making as he and Pippin had cultivated in younger days.  It pleased him to think that their legacy would be continued by a new generation, for of course he and Pippin were beyond such childish pursuits now.  However, despite the knowledge that Farmer Maggot’s crops were still at risk, Merry could not be content.</P>

<P>After the Great Quest and all it had entailed, it had been a relief to settle back down into life in the Shire, and Merry had relished the calm and predictability.  But now, some years on, he found that the tedium of the Shire was getting – well, a bit tedious, and a strange restlessness was growing in his heart.</P>

<P>Merry had always been an adventurous and imaginative hobbit, but nothing had prepared him for the vastness and possibilities of the world outside the Shire.  Of course, he couldn’t pretend that all his experiences on the quest had been good ones, no matter how much the tales of his and Pippin’s exploits grew in the telling.  But even taking into account the bad times, Merry’s journey to the other side of Middle Earth had broadened his horizons beyond the scope of the Shire.  It seemed to Merry that he had been infected by Bilbo Baggins’ wanderlust, and he was beginning to think it might be time to set out on another adventure.</P>

<P>This time, however, it would be on his own terms and, while he wasn’t planning on going alone, he also wasn’t prepared to broach the subject with Pippin.  Merry decided he had directed Pippin’s path long enough; besides, Pippin had more than shown he was capable of independence during his time in Minas Tirith.  They had been friends and confidants so long, though, that Merry was confident Pippin would eventually come to the same conclusions as he had, of his own accord.</P>

<P>Sure enough, over dinner one night, at the house they shared in Crickhollow, Pippin suddenly sighed and said, &quot;You know, Merry, peace and quiet are all very well, but don’t you find that life in the Shire is starting to feel a bit – &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Limited?&quot; Merry supplied.</P>

<P>&quot;Exactly!&quot;  Pippin grinned.</P>

<P>&quot;I’ve been thinking the same thing,&quot; Merry told him.  &quot;I’ve been feeling sort of twitchy lately, as if my feet want to take me off somewhere unexpected.  I was hoping you might feel the same way, but I didn’t want to put ideas in your head if you were happy here.&quot;</P>

<P>He recognised the old mischievous glint in Pippin’s eye that was sparked by his words, and it warmed his heart.</P>

<P>Pippin’s grin widened.  &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;</P>

<P>Given free rein by Pippin’s interest, Merry quickly warmed to his subject.  &quot;I think it’s time we made good on a promise.&quot;  Pippin looked intrigued.  &quot;Do you remember what Treebeard told us about the Entwives?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That the Ents had lost them?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Merry confirmed.  &quot;And he asked us to send word if we ever found them.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin’s brow furrowed in confusion.  &quot;We haven’t found them,&quot; he said with a simplicity that made Merry smile.</P>

<P>&quot;But we haven’t looked!  Don’t you think we owe it to Treebeard to put some effort in on his behalf?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I see!&quot;  Pippin leaned forward, his expression eager.  &quot;Where do you think we should start?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Merry said thoughtfully, &quot;Treebeard mentioned something about the Elves having songs that tell of the Entwives.  I know Lord Elrond and Lady Galadriel have left Middle Earth but Legolas is still around and he might know something.&quot;</P>

<P>For the first time, Pippin looked slightly uncertain.  &quot;Mirkwood is ever such a long way away, Merry,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>&quot;You don’t have any pressing business here to get back for, do you?&quot;  Pippin shook his head.  &quot;Well then, what’s to stop us travelling all the way to the other side of the world if we want to?&quot; Merry enthused.  &quot;I want to have an adventure, Pippin!  I want to get out of here and see more of this world that we helped to save!  And this time, it’ll be how we want it to be – no battles, no all-important quest, just the two of us out on the road trying to do something nice for a friend.  What do you say?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin nodded decisively and asked, &quot;When do we start?&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Two days of frenzied packing and organising ensued – though they had no deadline for leaving, once they had decided to go, Merry and Pippin found the excitement of the journey overtook them and added a sense of urgency to their plans.  Once everything was in order, they took a short trip to Hobbiton and turned up on Sam’s doorstep unannounced.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, hello, you two!&quot; he exclaimed in surprise on answering the door.  &quot;What brings you here?  Come in, come in!&quot;</P>

<P>They followed their gracious host through into the kitchen, where Sam ushered them into seats and bustled about making tea.</P>

<P>&quot;Rosie’s off visiting her mother with the children,&quot; he told them.  &quot;She’ll be sorry to have missed you.  Now,&quot; he continued, once they were all sitting down with a steaming mug in front of them, &quot;tell me what’s going on.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry started in surprise at the question.  &quot;Why, Sam!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;How do you know we didn’t just stop by to catch up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because I know you, Master Merry,&quot; Sam said with a wry grin, &quot;and you’ve got that look about you – like you used to get when you were planning some sort of mischief.&quot;  Merry glanced across at Pippin, who was doing his best to look innocent, but evidently Sam wasn’t fooled.  &quot;And you, Master Pippin,&quot; he accused with a stab of his finger.  &quot;I know that look of yours, too, and it usually means trouble.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My dear Sam!&quot; Pippin protested in mock indignation.  &quot;Nothing could be further from our minds.  In fact, it’s precisely to stay out of trouble that we’re here.&quot;</P>

<P>Sam looked unconvinced.</P>

<P>&quot;We’re planning a little trip,&quot; Merry told him.  &quot;To be honest, we’ve had enough of being upstanding citizens and we thought we’d better take ourselves out of the Shire for a while before we get ourselves in trouble.  We were wondering if we could borrow Bill to help carry our supplies.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bill?&quot; Sam echoed, obviously struggling to take in the quickfire information.  &quot;But where are you going?  How long will you be gone?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A few months, maybe more,&quot; Merry said.  &quot;We’re not sure how long it’s going to take for us to get where we’re going.  We’re off to see Legolas first, but who knows where we might end up after that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don’t suppose you’d like to come with us, would you?&quot; Pippin asked.</P>

<P>Sam shook his head violently.  &quot;No more adventuring for me, thank you very much!&quot; he said firmly.  &quot;I plan to keep my feet well within the borders of the Shire for a long time to come yet.  I’ve had more than enough travelling and, after all we went through the last time, I’m surprised to hear you two so eager to leave again.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry just shrugged and grinned, knowing that it would be impossible to explain their wanderlust to homeloving Sam.  &quot;If you’re not interested in coming with us, would you mind looking in on the house at Crickhollow once in a while and making sure the garden doesn’t get too overgrown?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course!&quot; Sam agreed readily.  Then his expression grew more serious.  &quot;If I let you take Bill, you will look after him, won’t you?&quot; he asked.  &quot;He’s had more than enough adventures to last him a lifetime, too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bill will be quite safe,&quot; Pippin promised.  &quot;We’re not going anywhere dangerous – just looking up some old friends.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And hoping to make some new ones,&quot; Merry added.  He didn’t elaborate, and Sam didn’t ask for more details, clearly happier knowing as little as possible about his friends’ plans.</P>

<P>They talked about other things as they finished their tea, and then Merry and Pippin waited at the front gate while Sam fetched Bill.  He led the pony round to the front of the garden and handed his reins to Merry.</P>

<P>&quot;Now, you keep an eye on Mister Merry and Mister Pippin, Bill,&quot; he told the pony.  &quot;They may not mean to get into trouble, but they usually do anyway, so it’ll be up to you to look after them.&quot;  Bill snorted and nuzzled Sam’s shoulder as if saying goodbye.</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t worry, Sam,&quot; Merry reassured him.  &quot;We’ll bring Bill back safe and sound.&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The following morning saw Merry and Pippin setting out from Crickhollow, mounted on their own ponies, with Bill bringing up the rear.  The sun was shining and the orchards were in bloom, making the Shire fairly glow with pink and white petals.  Merry looked around at his home and thought for a moment that perhaps Sam was right; they must be mad to want to leave such beautiful surroundings.  But then he turned his eyes to the horizon and a surge of excitement rushed through him at the prospect of what lay ahead.  This time, he meant to enjoy the act of travelling through Middle Earth, taking the opportunity to look at the changing countryside as they passed through it, something that had not been possible on their last journey, given the sense of danger and urgency, and the various mishaps that had altered their route.</P>

<P>It seemed strange, but very welcome, to be leaving the Shire on horseback, in daylight and free from pursuit.</P>

<P>Merry gestured at the peaceful environment and the quiet road and said, &quot;Makes a change, doesn’t it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Pippin agreed, as always following Merry’s thought processes quite easily.  &quot;This is much more civilised than last time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Camping out will be fun,&quot; Merry said.  &quot;At least we haven’t got Strider not letting us stop for second breakfast.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; Pippin exclaimed.  &quot;I know we were in a hurry to get to Rivendell, but the man’s idea of travel arrangements was positively barbaric.&quot;</P>

<P>They journeyed on in companionable chatter, and Merry was gratified to see Pippin more cheerful and animated than he had been for a long while.  It proved to Merry that the trip was a good idea, and his own mood improved even more at the obvious pleasure of his friend.</P>

<P>As the light began to wane on the first day of their journey, Merry started to look for a suitable place to stop for the night.  A sheltered hollow at the side of the road presented itself, but the hobbits were surprised to discover that it was already occupied, the flickering light of a camp fire betraying the presence of another traveller.</P>

<P>Before they could discuss whether or not to move on, a friendly voice emanated from the deepening shadows.</P>

<P>&quot;Well met!  Would you care to share my fire?&quot;</P>

<P>Never one to pass up an invitation, Merry nodded to Pippin’s glanced enquiry, and the two hobbits made their way into the hollow to meet their host.</P>

<P>Seated beside a small fire was a man in robes of rough-woven brown wool.  His curly hair was cut close to his scalp and his beard was neatly trimmed to complement open features and warm brown eyes.  A chestnut horse was tethered to a tree at the edge of the clearing and a large raven sat perched on the man’s shoulder.</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin quickly secured their two ponies and Bill alongside the man’s horse, making sure the animals could reach the lush, spring grass at their feet, then seated themselves at the fire at his gesture.</P>

<P>&quot;You are most welcome, good hobbits,&quot; their host said, &quot;for I require directions and some local knowledge if you are willing to provide them.  I am Radagast the Brown and I mean to make myself known in the Shire.&quot;</P>

<P>A flash of recognition passed across Merry’s thoughts at the man’s moniker and he asked, &quot;Are you a wizard?&quot;</P>

<P>Radagast smiled broadly.  &quot;I am indeed,&quot; he confirmed.  &quot;An old acquaintance of mine – Gandalf – spoke very highly of the Shire and its folk, and I thought perhaps that, now Gandalf has left these shores, it might be time for another wizard to make himself a friend there.  I have never been much of a traveller, but times are different now and I feel a desire to see more of this world.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Any friend of Gandalf is a friend of ours,&quot; Merry stated.  &quot;Meriadoc Brandybuck at your service, sir, and this is my cousin, Peregrin Took.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you can call us Merry and Pippin if you like,&quot; Pippin added quickly, as always uncomfortable with formality.</P>

<P>Radagast’s eyes widened in surprise.  &quot;It would be an honour,&quot; he breathed.  &quot;To think that the very first hobbits I meet should be world-famous heroes!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, piffle!&quot; Merry protested, reddening in response to the wizard’s awe.  &quot;We mostly just caused trouble and got in the way.  I’m sure you’ve done much grander things wizarding about the place than we ever did.&quot;</P>

<P>Radagast chuckled.  &quot;I can see why Gandalf prized your company so highly,&quot; he said.  &quot;You are gracious indeed.  I would dearly love to hear the tale of your adventures, if you would be willing to tell it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, we weren’t really there for most of the important bits,&quot; Merry said.  &quot;And there are some bits we’d rather not talk about, if you don’t mind.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I understand,&quot; Radagast replied softly.  &quot;Forgive me.  I should not have pried.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin spoke up.  &quot;We could tell you about our visit to Fangorn Forest,&quot; he offered.  &quot;That’s a good story, and it’s what brings us out of the Shire now.&quot;</P>

<P>Radagast nodded eagerly, so the two hobbits launched into the tale of how they had met Treebeard and how their friendship with him had led to their current search for the Entwives.  It was a disjointed narrative, with many interruptions as they corrected and argued with one another over the details of the story but, at last, it was told, though the full dark of night was upon them by the end.</P>

<P>&quot;I don’t suppose you know anything about the Entwives, do you?&quot; Merry asked the wizard.</P>

<P>&quot;I’m afraid not, friend Merry,&quot; came the reply, &quot;but I expect there is some record of them in the archives at Minas Tirith.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Right, that’ll be the next stop after Mirkwood, then,&quot; Pippin decided.  &quot;It would be good to see Aragorn again, after all – King Elessar, I suppose we should call him now.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He’ll always be Strider the scruffy ranger to me,&quot; Merry grinned.  &quot;It seems strange to think of him being the King of Gondor, though I suppose there always was something regal about him, even in the beginning.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If I’d known we’d end up going to Gondor, I would have packed my uniform,&quot; Pippin mused.</P>

<P>&quot;Show-off!&quot; teased Merry with a smile.</P>

<P>Radagast brought them back to the practicalities of their situation.  &quot;You have set before yourselves a very long journey.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin countered, &quot;Well, we walked as far as Lothlorien last time, but I’m glad we’ve got the ponies with us.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We’re hoping to get back to the Shire before winter sets in,&quot; Merry said, &quot;but we’re really not sure how long this trip is going to take.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I may be able to help with that,&quot; Radagast said unexpectedly, then turned his attention to the bird on his shoulder.  He whispered a few inaudible words and the bird suddenly launched itself into the air, quickly flying out of sight.</P>

<P>&quot;Elswyth should return by mid-morning with an answer to your problem,&quot; the wizard told them, &quot;if you are prepared to delay your departure that long.&quot;</P>

<P>He refused to explain further, merely smiling when Merry and Pippin asked him what he meant.</P>

<P>The three travellers shared a meal, each contributing from their supplies of food.  As they ate, Merry and Pippin told Radagast all about the Shire and assured him that he would receive a warm welcome there, especially if he had any skill with fireworks.  Eventually, they ran out of conversation and bedded down for the night, the hobbits burning with curiosity as to what surprises the morning might bring.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The sun was already high in the sky when Merry awoke the next morning to the sounds and smells of breakfast being made.  He opened his eyes and turned his head to see the welcome sight of Pippin bending over a sizzling frying pan.</P>

<P>&quot;Morning, Sleepyhead!&quot; Pippin called, alerted by Merry’s movement.  &quot;Radagast’s just gone to fetch some water, so we can have tea with our breakfast.  You’ll be on clean-up duty since you haven’t helped with the preparation.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry sighed at this news, but got up and joined his friend at the small fire.  &quot;Did he say anything more about what we’re waiting for this morning?&quot; he asked.</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; Pippin replied in exasperation, &quot;even though I did ask several times.  He just kept smiling smugly at me and telling me to wait and see.  The fellow’s made an art out of aggravation.  I’ve been trying to think of what it might be, but what could a bird bring that will help us on our journey?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don’t know, Pip,&quot; Merry said, smiling at Pippin’s annoyance.  &quot;I guess we’ll just have to wait and see!&quot;</P>

<P>He received a whack on the arm from the spoon in Pippin’s hand for that, and jumped back with a yelp, still grinning.  Their trip was turning into an adventure already and they’d been out of the Shire less than a day.  Merry took a deep breath of the crisp morning air, enjoying the heady combination of spring blooms, anticipation and frying sausages.</P>

<P>The three travellers shared another companionable meal, with the wizard remaining stubbornly close-mouthed about his approaching surprise.  Merry had washed the pots in a nearby stream and was packing them away again, when the raven suddenly descended from the sky and landed on Radagast’s shoulder.  The bird chattered in the wizard’s ear for a moment and then promptly put her head under her wing and went to sleep.</P>

<P>Radagast smiled broadly at the two hobbits and announced, &quot;Elswyth’s trip has been most successful.&quot;  The sound of more wings drew the hobbit’s attention upwards.  &quot;Behold, your new mode of transport!&quot;</P>

<P>Merry shaded his eyes against the glare of the sun and searched the sky for the source of the sound.  From behind the treeline, two massive forms soon became visible; a pair of giant eagles soaring through the air, with something suspended between them.  As the hobbits watched, the huge golden birds descended in unison, setting their burden gently on the ground in the clearing before alighting gracefully next to it.  Now that it was close to, Merry could see that the object they had been carrying was a large basket with high sides and a securely fastened little door allowing access to the inside.</P>

<P>Merry exchanged a dumbfounded glance with Pippin as Radagast stepped forward to greet the new arrivals.</P>

<P>&quot;Welcome, my friends, and thank you for answering my summons so quickly.  These noble hobbits are the close companions of the two your kin rescued from Mount Doom after Sauron’s downfall, and they require transport across Middle Earth on a quest of their own.  Will you accompany them and speed them on their way?&quot;</P>

<P>The slightly larger of the two eagles replied in a lilting, musical voice, &quot;Gladly shall we do this, Radagast Birdfriend.  Let them step forwards and present themselves.&quot;</P>

<P>Radagast ushered the two hobbits in front of him, chuckling at their stunned reaction.</P>

<P>It was Pippin who recovered his composure first, bowing before the great birds and saying excitedly, &quot;Hello!  I’m Pippin and this is Merry.  Are you really going to take us up in the air in that basket?&quot;</P>

<P>The eagle who had spoken before cocked his head to one side and replied, &quot;Indeed, little master, if you desire it.  My name is Finovar and this is my brother, Findroval.&quot;  The other eagle extended one taloned foot and dipped his head in acknowledgement.  &quot;We would be honoured to help you on your way.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!&quot; Pippin exclaimed, turning back to his cousin.  &quot;We’re going to fly!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, I can see that, Pip,&quot; Merry replied.  He next addressed himself to the eagles.  &quot;Thank you for your kind offer.  This will certainly make things easier for us – and a lot more fun!&quot;  Then he had a sudden thought.  &quot;But what are we going to do with the ponies?  They won’t fit in the basket with us, and I don’t expect they’d be too keen on flying anyway.&quot;</P>

<P>The wizard cleared his throat.  &quot;If you would allow me to be of some further assistance, I will gladly escort your steeds back to the Shire, since that is where I am going.  If you will entrust them to my care, I will see them safely home."</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you, Radagast,&quot; Merry beamed.  &quot;When you reach the Shire, go to Hobbiton and ask for Samwise Gamgee.  One of the ponies belongs to him, and he’ll look after the other two for us until we get back.&quot;</P>

<P>Radagast helped the two hobbits transfer all their supplies into the basket.  Under the eagles’ direction, they stacked everything in the centre so as to keep the weight distribution even and leave the cushioned edges free for sitting or lying down.  Before too long, they were ready to depart.</P>

<P>Pippin jumped eagerly into the basket, his face alight with excitement, while Merry followed more cautiously.  Radagast fastened the door securely behind them and then stood back to watch them depart.  The eagles took up positions on either side.</P>

<P>Finovar called out, &quot;Hold tight, young hobbits!&quot;</P>

<P>An unnatural wind sprang up as the eagles started to beat their wings, their strokes perfectly in time.  The simultaneous takeoff was clearly well-practised and Merry watched, amazed, as the huge birds rose from the ground together and took up the weight of the basket at exactly the same moment, causing it to lift smoothly into the air.  As they gained height, Merry wedged himself into the corner of the basket, bracing his arms against the sides, suddenly a little uncertain about their new vehicle.  Pippin had no such qualms; he had piled up some of the cushions and was standing atop them to look over the edge, not even holding on as he waved merrily to the rapidly diminishing figure of Radagast down below.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry, come and look!&quot; he cried over the noise of the air displaced by their ascent.  &quot;This is wonderful!  Everything looks so small!&quot;</P>

<P>Very carefully, Merry pushed himself to his feet and made his way to Pippin’s side.  He did not climb up on the cushions, instead clutching tightly to the rim of the basket as he peered out over it.  A wave of dizziness passed through him as what seemed like the whole world came into view below them.  He closed his eyes, but that only made the sensation worse, so he forced himself to look again and, after a few moments, the initial shock wore off.  The view was spectacular.  Radagast was already out of sight and the landscape stretched out on all sides like a vast and incredibly detailed painting.  Merry had wanted to see more of Middle Earth, but he had never imagined he might see so much of it all at once, and the experience was quite humbling.  He suddenly felt very small and he sat down again quickly, not keen to prolong the feeling.</P>

<P>Soon afterwards, Pippin joined him, seated on the floor of the basket, and they discovered that conversation was quite possible when they were sheltered from the wind by the high sides.</P>

<P>&quot;Nobody back home is going to believe this,&quot; Pippin said.</P>

<P>Merry laughed.  &quot;They will when we land in the middle of the party field in Hobbiton!&quot; he pointed out, and Pippin grinned with delight at the idea.</P>

<P>The eagles flew on, their wingbeats strong and steady, never faltering.  Merry watched them, marvelling at their grace and power as they cut through the air.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Pippin was once more leaning almost perilously far out of the basket.  Merry had been keeping a slightly nervous eye on him and was about to call him back from the edge when he suddenly cried out.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!  Merry!  We’re here!&quot;</P>

<P>Merry scrambled to his side and looked out to see a huge forest stretching before them.  They had indeed arrived at Mirkwood.  Almost immediately, the eagles began their descent, and soon the basked landed with a barely discernible bump in a field on the outskirts of the forest.  The eagles alighted on either side like before, Finovar turning to watch the hobbits as they unfastened the door and jumped out.</P>

<P>&quot;This is where we will leave you for now,&quot; Finovar told them.  &quot;We do not like to enter dense trees unless we have to and, besides, it would be impolite to descend into the heart of the elven realm without invitation.  Each of us will guard your belongings while the other hunts, so you need not worry about leaving anything behind, and we will meet you here when you are ready to move on.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you, Finovar,&quot; Merry said sincerely.</P>

<P>He and Pippin collected up a small pack each and bid farewell to the eagles before making their way towards the treeline.  They were still some distance away when a single elf appeared and stepped out to meet them.  His clothing was cunningly woven to resemble the leaf patterns behind him and his long hair was braided to stop it falling in his face.  He seemed very tall to Merry and his features, though guarded, bore the characteristic youthful beauty of the elven people.</P>

<P>&quot;Greetings, strangers,&quot; he said, his voice light but with a hint of authority.  &quot;None but friends may enter the forest.  Speak your names so you will be strangers no more.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin introduced themselves and, once again, the light of recognition dawned at the sound of their names.</P>

<P>&quot;Prince Legolas will be delighted to hear of your visit,&quot; the elf said with a graceful smile.  &quot;I am Elatha, one of the perimeter scouts..  Allow me to escort you to him.&quot;</P>

<P>Elatha led them through the wood as the shadows lengthened.  He was most careful throughout their journey to keep to a pace that was comfortable for the hobbits and to ensure no branches swung back after his passing to harm them in any way.  After they had been walking for some time, they passed another elf going in the opposite direction.  Elatha nodded a greeting, and Merry presumed this was Elatha’s replacement on the border patrol.  He had heard that some elves had telepathic powers, but he was nonetheless impressed by the smooth operation of their protection of their home.</P>

<P>By the time they reached the first signs of habitation, it was almost dusk and the fading light made it difficult to tell where the trees ended and the buildings began.  In some cases, it seemed the elves’ homes were actually constructed as part of the forest, reaching up into the branches of the biggest trees.  Merry and Pippin were escorted inside one of the larger buildings and led up a winding staircase to an ornately carved door at the top of a tower.</P>

<P>&quot;You will find the prince at leisure in his library,&quot; Elatha informed them, gesturing at the door.  &quot;Would you like me to announce you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; Pippin said with a grin.  &quot;We’ll surprise him.&quot;</P>

<P>Elatha smiled back.  &quot;Well then, I shall take my leave of you.  Perhaps you would like some food sent up from the kitchens so you may speak privately with Prince Legolas?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh yes, that would be marvellous!  Thank you very much,&quot; Merry replied.</P>

<P>Elatha bowed slightly, then turned and disappeared back down the stairs.  Merry exchanged an excited glance with Pippin before reaching out and knocking on the door.  A familiar voice came from within the room beyond the door, speaking an unfamiliar language.  Merry looked back at Pippin, who shrugged.</P>

<P>&quot;Shall we assume that meant ‘come in’?&quot; Pippin suggested, turning the door handle.</P>

<P>The door swung open to reveal a high-ceilinged, circular room, lined with books.  There was a balcony running all the way round, to provide access to the upper levels, and the floor was taken up by a large table and several comfortable chairs.  One of these was occupied by Legolas, who lounged at ease, one leg thrown over the arm of his chair, a book lying open in his lap.  He glanced up as the hobbits entered and immediately leapt to his feet, setting his book upon the table and rushing forward to meet them.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!  Pippin!&quot; he exclaimed, a warm smile gracing his delicate features.  &quot;What a delightful surprise!  I never would have guessed it was you knocking on my door, but you are welcome indeed.&quot;</P>

<P>Legolas ushered the two hobbits into chairs and sat back down himself.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s good to see you too, Legolas,&quot; Merry said.  &quot;It seems like such a long time since we were all together in Minas Tirith.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Indeed it does,&quot; Legolas agreed.  &quot;How go things in the Shire?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, everything’s back to normal,&quot; Pippin told him.  &quot;Except, of course, that Frodo is no longer with us.  You know he travelled across the sea with Gandalf a couple of years ago?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Legolas said, his expression growing more sombre.  When he continued speaking, there was a wistful note in his voice.  &quot;He will have found peace and rest at last in the Undying Lands.  It is the best place for him after all that happened.&quot;  Then Legolas seemed to pull himself back into the present.  &quot;What of Sam?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He and Rosie are working on their third child,&quot; Merry revealed.</P>

<P>Legolas’ face split into a wide smile again.  &quot;That is wonderful news!&quot;  His eyes sparkled.  &quot;And the two of you?  Do you have wives and young hobbit lads and lasses waiting for you at home?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Pippin exclaimed.  &quot;I’m not ready to settle down yet!&quot;  He glanced sideways at his cousin.  &quot;Though I expect Estella Bolger will be less than pleased to discover Merry has left the Shire without saying goodbye…&quot;  He chuckled as Merry went red.</P>

<P>&quot;Anyway,&quot; Merry said briskly, becoming very businesslike all of a sudden.  &quot;We are not here for smalltalk.  We have important matters to attend to.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; Legolas replied with a quick wink at Pippin.  &quot;I am at your service for whatever you require.&quot;</P>

<P>Before Merry could continue, however, there was another knock at the door and three elfmaids entered the room, carrying dishes of food.  They laid their burdens carefully on the table, curtsied to Legolas and went away again.</P>

<P>&quot;Would you care to discuss your important business over dinner?&quot; Legolas asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Business can wait!&quot; Merry said.  &quot;Dinner deserves a hobbit’s full attention, don’t you agree, Pip?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Absolutely!&quot;</P>

<P>They set to the food with the kind of gusto only a hobbit could muster.  After asking, with a wry smile, if it was acceptable for him to talk while they ate, Legolas told them of what he had been doing since they had last met.  He regaled them with tales of his travels with Gimli, of how he had tried to teach the dwarf to appreciate the beauty of the woods, while Gimli had attempted to show the claustrophobic Legolas the advantages of living underground.</P>

<P>Merry listened to the soothing tones of the elf’s voice with great contentment, very much enjoying being in Legolas’ company once more.  The war had been terrible, but the friendships he and Pippin had forged during those dark times would last far longer than the bad memories.  He thought back to a long distant version of himself, who had never imagined laying eyes on an elf, let alone sitting and sharing tales with one in his own library.  He wished, as always, that Frodo could be there with them but he knew, as Legolas had said, that Frodo was better off across the sea.</P>

<P>When the food was finished, which, with hobbits involved, didn’t take long, they retired back to the armchairs with the remains of the wine.</P>

<P>&quot;So,&quot; Legolas said, &quot;now will you tell me why you are really here?  For, while I have enjoyed your company immensely and need no other explanation for your visit than that, I must confess I am quite curious as to your true purpose.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Pippin began, &quot;we were hoping you would be able to point us in the right direction on something.  You see, we’re looking for the Entwives and Treebeard said the elves had songs about them, so we came here to find out more.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A noble quest, my friends,&quot; Legolas said.  &quot;I will do what I can to aid you.  It was the elves who awoke the trees and taught them to speak.  The Ents were known to the Eldar in ancient times, and they conversed much, so I am sure the history of the Entwives must be recorded somewhere in our lore.&quot;  He gestured around at the countless books surrounding them, and smiled.  &quot;It may take me a while to find the information you need.  Would you care to stay the night, and we will meet again in the morning to discuss the matter further?&quot;</P>

<P>At that moment, Pippin yawned widely.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, that answers my question,&quot; Legolas chuckled.  &quot;I will show you to the guest quarters.&quot;  He laid a hand on each hobbit’s shoulder and guided them to the door.  &quot;It really is very good to see you both again.&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The next morning found Merry and Pippin in a luxuriously appointed chamber, eating a sumptuous breakfast and being waited on by several elves.  Merry had noticed that, throughout their time in Mirkwood, every time something was provided for them, it was brought or attended to by a different elf.  All of them treated the hobbits with great deference and politeness, but Merry also sensed a barely concealed curiosity.  He had thought elves to be above such behaviour, and it amused him to think of their hosts all wanting to catch a glimpse of Legolas’ famous guests.</P>

<P>Eventually, after they had eaten, bathed and been served an unexpected but very welcome second breakfast, they were escorted back up to the tower library to meet with Legolas again.  They found him poring over books and maps that were spread out all over the table.</P>

<P>&quot;Good morning!&quot; he said upon their entrance.  &quot;I trust you have been well cared for?&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin nodded vigorously.  &quot;We’ve just finished second breakfast,&quot; Pippin told him.  &quot;You elves certainly know how to cater to hobbits.&quot;</P>

<P>Legolas chuckled.  &quot;Well, I would have hoped to have learned that lesson after travelling with you and hearing your complaints against Aragorn and Gandalf in that regard.  I have arranged for elevenses to be served up here shortly.&quot;  He smiled as the hobbits’ faces lit up.  &quot;In the meantime, I have uncovered much that should be of interest to you in your search.&quot;  He pulled one of the books towards him.  &quot;It seems that the beings you refer to as Entwives were once Wood Elves.  They were particularly interested in tending to the burgeoning forests and formed a special relationship with the Ents, living with them deep in the woods and cutting themselves off even from other elves.  They disapproved of our building cities, even though we have always been careful to exist in harmony with nature.  They worked with the Ents to communicate with the trees and plants, asking them to provide shelters and homes by growing in certain ways.  Over the centuries, they changed and became more attuned to the forest, growing almost more treelike themselves.  They were very elusive, staying away from the other peoples of Middle Earth and discouraging anyone from entering the forests where they lived.  Men made up stories about them, calling them dryads or wood nymphs, not knowing that they were really elves by origin.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin had been listening with rapt attention, but now Pippin broke in with a question.  &quot;You mean the Ents actually married elves?&quot;  His tone was incredulous, but his next words were slightly hesitant.  &quot;How would that, um… work, exactly?&quot;</P>

<P>Legolas laughed at his uncertainty.  &quot;The term ‘Entwives’ is a little misleading, though I suppose that must have been how the Ents viewed them, after a fashion.  The Entwives did not mate with the Ents, if that is what you are asking.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin looked very relieved, but Merry was still confused.  &quot;Treebeard said there hadn’t been any more Ents since they lost the Entwives – if they didn’t mate, how did they produce more Ents?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That, Merry, is a very good question,&quot; Legolas replied.  &quot;Ents did not evolve naturally, like hobbits or men, they were created long ago as guardians of the forest, and so they have no way to reproduce themselves.  Apparently, one of the tasks of the Entwives was to care for the Ents and create more when their numbers dwindled.  They are the only ones who know how to do this, though – it is not recorded anywhere in the books I have found.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So, when the Entwives were lost, the Ents were left with nobody to create more of them,&quot; Merry mused.  &quot;But where did they go?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;From Fangorn, it is recorded that they moved east and made homes for themselves in the northernmost region of Ithilien,&quot; Legolas explained.</P>

<P>&quot;Treebeard told us that,&quot; Pippin remembered.  &quot;But he said their homes were destroyed in a war and that’s when the Entwives vanished completely.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry had a sudden awful thought.  &quot;You don’t suppose they were all killed in the war, do you?  It would be terrible to come all this way only to find out they’re all dead.&quot;</P>

<P>Legolas was unable to reassure him.  &quot;I am afraid that is one question I cannot answer, as our records of them end with their disappearance from Ithilien.  I am sorry not to be able to be more help.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Don’t worry, Legolas,&quot; Pippin said.  &quot;We haven’t exhausted all our options yet.  Radagast said we might be able to find more information in the archives at Minas Tirith, so I guess we’ll head there next.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry looked at how far they had to go on the map.  &quot;Good job we’ve got the eagles with us, isn’t it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Radagast?  Eagles?&quot; Legolas queried, so they told him about meeting the wizard and their subsequent acquaintance with Finovar and Findroval.  &quot;You certainly have a knack for making friends in the right places,&quot; Legolas said when they’d finished, clearly impressed.  &quot;And I agree that the eagles will be very useful to you, not just because of the distance involved.  If you do find out where the Entwives have gone, I fear there may be a time factor to your quest, as well.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why is that?&quot; Merry wanted to know.</P>

<P>&quot;Because the time of the elves is over, my friends,&quot; Legolas told them seriously.  &quot;Most of us have left Middle Earth, and those of us that are still here will be leaving soon.&quot;</P>

<P>The hobbits’ faces must have betrayed their dismay at this news, since Legolas continued hurriedly, &quot;I do not speak of myself, little ones.  I have no intention of departing these shores while I have mortal friends still here to share my life with.&quot;  Merry and Pippin sighed in relief.  &quot;The Entwives, on the other hand, are a different matter,&quot; Legolas pointed out.  &quot;If they have secluded themselves even from the Ents, they will have nothing to hold them here.  They will be feeling the call of the sea and most likely preparing to leave, if they have not done so already.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We’ll just have to give them a reason to stay,&quot; Pippin said with determination.</P>

<P>&quot;That’s right,&quot; Merry agreed.  &quot;And I suppose we had better get moving if we’re to find them and stop them from leaving.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I had hoped you would stay longer in Mirkwood,&quot; Legolas said, &quot;but perhaps you would allow me to accompany you to Minas Tirith.  It has been far too long since my last visit there, and I would like to find out where your quest sends you next.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course you can come,&quot; Merry told him.  &quot;And thank you for all your help so far.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It has been my pleasure,&quot; the elf replied, then added, &quot;I must make some preparations before I can leave.  Do you mind waiting a while and having elevenses before departing?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin grinned.  &quot;Do you really have to ask?&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>
<P>Once the hobbits had eaten and Legolas had made whatever arrangements were necessary for his absence from Mirkwood, the three friends made their way back through the forest to the open land where the eagles were waiting.  Merry and Pippin introduced Legolas to Finovar and Findroval, who were more than happy to take on an extra passenger.</P>

<P>Legolas inspected the basket with interest.  &quot;This is wonderful workmanship,&quot; he said, running his hands over the elaborate weave.  &quot;How did you come to use such a device?&quot;</P>

<P>Finovar cocked his head to one side.  &quot;Radagast came to live with us for a time long ago and it is difficult to reach our mountain home without wings, so he had a basket made for us to transport him.  He has been a good friend to us, so we always have one available for his use.  We were honoured when he asked us to carry members of the Fellowship, though this is the first time anyone other than Radagast has travelled in this fashion.&quot;  He turned to the hobbits.  &quot;Where next, little masters?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin announced, &quot;Minas Tirith!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Very well,&quot; the eagle replied.  &quot;Climb aboard and we shall be on our way.&quot;</P>

<P>The hobbits took up their now customary positions within the basket, but Legolas leapt up to balance on the edge, locking his arms around the ropes on one side to secure himself.</P>

<P>Merry looked up at him in amused exasperation.  &quot;You’re worse than Pippin,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>Legolas’ shimmering laughter floated down from above his head and the elf grinned at him with an almost childlike glee.  &quot;It is not every day I get the opportunity to take to the skies!&quot; he enthused.</P>

<P>Merry snorted.  &quot;Like I said, you’re worse than Pippin.&quot;</P>

<P>He was worried that Legolas’ example might prompt his reckless cousin to echo the elf’s position on the other side of the basket, but was relieved when Pippin merely knelt upon the piled cushions again to look out.  Legolas could look after himself, but Merry still found it difficult not to feel responsible for Pippin’s wellbeing.</P>

<P>Legolas made quite a striking sight as they lifted off.  He swayed with the motion of the basket, keeping his balance with consummate skill, his fine blond hair ruffled by the wind.  About an hour into the journey, he suddenly gave a cry and leaned further out, prompting Merry to step up in alarm and Pippin to jump across so that all three were on one side.  The basket tipped at the redistribution of weight, but the eagles compensated expertly, keeping the passengers safely inside.</P>

<P>Legolas pointed down towards the ground and called out, &quot;We are passing over the Brown Lands!&quot;</P>

<P>Merry peered out to see a barren and blasted landscape stretching like an ugly scar across the face of Middle Earth.  The land was well-named; nothing grew there and the earth was a uniform dull brown colour.  Legolas stepped lightly down from his perch and Merry could see a deep sorrow in his expression.</P>

<P>&quot;I have only ever skirted the edges of the Brown Lands before,&quot; he told the hobbits.  &quot;It pains me greatly to see the devastation in this way.  The land has suffered much at the grasping hand of evil and it still does not heal, even though the evil has now passed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Treebeard told us that the gardens of the Entwives were very beautiful,&quot; Merry said.  &quot;It’s a shame they were destroyed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It is indeed,&quot; Legolas agreed.  &quot;But perhaps it does not have to remain so.&quot;  With that, he climbed back up to his vantage-point on the edge of the basket and examined the landscape below with a thoughtful expression gracing his delicate features.</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin busied themselves with a satisfying luncheon, and it didn’t seem long before Legolas called their attention to the world outside the basket again, this time to let them know that they were approaching Minas Tirith.</P>

<P>A mixture of emotions coursed through Merry as he looked down on the magnificent White City of Gondor.  He was excited about seeing Aragorn again, but he could not view the Pelennor Fields without remembering the great battle in which he had fought.  He looked across to see a similar conflict evident in Pippin’s eyes and he reached out to squeeze his cousin’s arm.  Pippin met his gaze and they smiled at each other, understanding passing between them before they both dismissed their cares and focused on looking forward rather than back.</P>

<P>The eagles made a graceful descent to the wide courtyard at the top of the city, landing in front of the famous white tree, which was covered in blossom.  The sentries posted outside the citadel gawked at this unexpected arrival, but immediately relaxed when Legolas leapt over the side of the basket and waved to them.  He waited for the hobbits to climb out, then turned to Finovar.</P>

<P>&quot;I thank you for our safe passage,&quot; he said politely.  &quot;Never have I experienced a more exhilarating journey.&quot;</P>

<P>Finovar bowed his acceptance of the elf’s gratitude.  &quot;If you are happy to remain here for the night,&quot; he said, addressing all three, &quot;we will depart and return in the morning to learn your plans.&quot;</P>

<P>At the passengers’ agreement, the two eagles deftly extricated their claws from the carrying ropes and launched themselves back into the air, leaving the basket behind.</P>

<P>When the three travellers turned their steps towards the citadel, they discovered that one of the sentries had disappeared, presumably having gone to alert those inside to the presence of visitors.  This was quickly confirmed when two figures appeared in the doorway.  One of them gave a cry of delight and immediately started running towards them.  Within moments, Merry found himself wrapped in Eowyn’s embrace.</P>

<P>&quot;Merry!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;How wonderful to see you!&quot;</P>

<P>He hugged her back enthusiastically, as the other two looked on in amusement.  Eowyn seemed suddenly to remember her manners as she released Merry and turned to greet both Pippin and Legolas, the former with a kiss and the latter with a smile.  By this time, the other figure had come close enough to be identified as Faramir, who also greeted the three warmly.</P>

<P>&quot;I’m afraid King Elessar and Queen Arwen are held up by a party of delegates from the outlying regions,&quot; he told them.  &quot;Will our company suffice until they are free?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I don’t know,&quot; Pippin replied, puffing out his chest in mock indignation.  &quot;As a knight of Gondor, I would normally expect a royal welcome, not being fobbed off onto a lowly steward.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My deepest apologies, Sir Peregrin,&quot; Faramir said gravely, though his eyes sparkled.  &quot;I must say, however, that a knight who appears without his uniform should not quibble over protocol.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry grinned.  &quot;He’s got you there, Pip!&quot; he chuckled.</P>

<P>Eowyn and Faramir escorted the hobbits and the elf inside, leading them to a cosy parlour that was evidently part of the private quarters of the palace rather than an official audience chamber.  The guests were plied with food and drink, of which the hobbits partook gladly, it being somewhat past tea-time.</P>

<P>&quot;What brings the three of you here, ferried by eagles?&quot; Faramir asked once they were all settled.</P>

<P>Legolas answered him, as Merry and Pippin both had their mouths full.  &quot;I am but an escort to these two,&quot; he revealed, &quot;who are on a quest for information.  I will let them explain themselves once Aragorn and Arwen have arrived.  In the meantime, perhaps you can answer a question I have, Faramir?&quot;</P>

<P>The steward nodded readily.  &quot;I am at your service.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do the Brown Lands fall under Gondor’s rule?&quot; Legolas wanted to know.</P>

<P>Faramir thought for a moment.  &quot;I am not sure,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but I do not believe anyone else would contest for control of them.  Why do you ask?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We passed over them on our way here from Mirkwood,&quot; Legolas said.  &quot;I had not realised that the injury to the land was so great and I was wondering if anything might be done to reclaim it and make it bloom again.  I have felt recently the need of something to occupy myself and I believe I have found a project that would satisfy both myself and those of my brethren who similarly tire of our idleness in Mirkwood.  Do you think Aragorn would object to us setting up a colony in Ithilien to attend to the damaged land?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Most definitely not,&quot; Faramir declared.  &quot;In fact, I am confident the king would welcome such a project and offer both men and resources to aid you.  I myself would be most interested in being involved in such an endeavour.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Now that the threat of Mordor has been vanquished, we should all be turning our attention to rectifying the effects of its evil,&quot; Eowyn agreed.  &quot;Your idea is a worthy one, Legolas, and I too would be glad to help.&quot;</P>

<P>At that point, Aragorn and Arwen burst into the room and another noisy round of greetings ensued.  The king and queen were in high spirits, their mood greatly affected by the unexpected arrival of such dear friends, and there was much laughter.</P>

<P>Eventually, everyone had hugged and exclaimed over everyone else, and Faramir brought the subject back to their visitors’ purpose.  &quot;Perhaps now you can tell us of your quest?&quot; he prompted Merry and Pippin.</P>

<P>The two hobbits once again told the tale of their journey, eliciting great interest in their audience.</P>

<P>&quot;My entire library is at your disposal,&quot; Aragorn offered at the story’s conclusion.  &quot;I am sure Hasilmir, the archivist, will be delighted to help you find the information you require.  If it exists within the palace records, he will be able to locate it.&quot;</P>

<P>The hobbits were keen to get started right away, but Arwen forestalled their enthusiasm.  &quot;Surely the search can wait until the morrow,&quot; she said.  &quot;Let us have dinner and spend the evening enjoying one another’s company.  It is too seldom that we are together; do not hurry to conclude your business and leave us.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin found themselves unable to refuse her and so they put their quest on hold for the rest of the day.  The old friends shared tales of recent years and reminisced about the adventures they had shared in times that now seemed very long ago.  Legolas and Faramir also set before Aragorn their proposal to reclaim the Brown Lands and he was enthusiastic in his approval of the scheme.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The following morning, the eagles returned and graciously agreed to take the elf and the two men on a trip to view the damaged land and scout out a possible location for the proposed settlement.  Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin rediscovered their determination to locate the Entwives, so Eowyn escorted them to the palace library to meet the archivist Aragorn had told them of the night before.</P>

<P>The chamber that held the library was far bigger than the one in Mirkwood where Legolas had discovered the Entwives’ origins.  There was a desk at the front where a man was writing in a huge ledger.  He looked up as they entered and immediately rose to his feet.  He was a large man, built more like a blacksmith than how Merry imagined a librarian would be.  He had a thatch of bright red hair and a bushy beard, which added to his imposing stature, but there was a ready smile on his face.</P>

<P>&quot;My Lady Eowyn,&quot; he said in a booming voice.  &quot;How may I be of service?&quot;</P>

<P>Eowyn gestured at her companions.  &quot;These hobbits are personal friends to the King,&quot; she told him.  &quot;They are looking for some information and hoped you might be able to locate it for them.  Merry, Pippin, this is Hasilmir, the palace archivist.  You'll be in good hands with him.  Now, I’m afraid I have some matters to attend to, but I will return later to find out how you are getting on.&quot;</P>

<P>With that, she left them.  Hasilmir beamed down at the hobbits.</P>

<P>&quot;May I ask the nature of your search?&quot; he enquired.</P>

<P>&quot;We’re trying to find the Entwives,&quot; Merry told him simply.</P>

<P>A frown creased Hasilmir’s forehead and he rubbed his beard with one hand.  &quot;Entwives…&quot; he mused.  &quot;I’m not familiar with them.  Can you tell me anything more?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Pippin elaborated.  &quot;They are a group of wood elves who used to live in Fangorn Forest with the Ents, but they moved east to set up home in the Brown Lands before they were destroyed."</P>

<P>&quot;Aha!&quot; Hasilmir exclaimed.  &quot;You mean the Dryads!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That’s right,&quot; Merry corroborated.  &quot;Legolas said that’s what men called them.  I’d forgotten.  We need to know where they went after they left the Brown Lands.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hmmm, let’s see,&quot; Hasilmir considered.  &quot;There ought to be mention of them in the histories somewhere, though they would have disappeared from these parts a very long time ago.  It might take some time to track down the right information.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We don’t mind staying to help,&quot; Merry offered.  &quot;If you point us in the right direction, we can look for ourselves, can’t we, Pip?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin didn’t look overly enthusiastic about trawling through history books, but he agreed reluctantly.  Hasilmir led them to the far corner of the library and lifted down several large tomes from one of the bookcases.  He set the volumes down on a nearby table and ushered the hobbits into two of the chairs around it.</P>

<P>&quot;These chronicle the earliest history of the region of Ithilien,&quot; he told them.  &quot;You may be able to find some references to the Dryads in here.  There may also be some record of them in the scrolls up in the tower.  Why don’t the two of you start with these and I’ll go and look up there.&quot;  He slapped them both on the back and strode off towards a door in the side of the room.</P>

<P>Pippin looked at the huge books in dismay.  &quot;How are we supposed to find anything in all this?&quot; he wailed.</P>

<P>Merry rolled up his sleeves and opened the first volume.  &quot;We won’t know if we don’t look, will we?  Come on, think how pleased Treebeard will be when we find the Entwives for him.&quot;</P>

<P>The two hobbits set to work, scanning the pages of the histories for any reference to Dryads or Entwives.  It was a daunting and wearying task, and they took many trips to the kitchens for sustenance to keep them going.  They eventually found passages referring to the gardens north of Ithilien and the mysterious beings who dwelt there, but the account ended with the war that had driven the Entwives out of the region, and no mention was made of where they had gone.</P>

<P>It was mid-afternoon and Merry and Pippin were about to give up when they heard a shout from above them and the sound of heavy feet coming down a flight of stairs heralded Hasilmir’s return to the main part of the library.  He rushed over to the table and threw a large scroll down on top of the books the hobbits were reading.</P>

<P>&quot;Success!&quot; he announced with evident satisfaction.  &quot;I believe I have precisely the information you are looking for!&quot;</P>

<P>The hobbits’ enthusiasm was immediately restored and they eagerly awaited Hasilmir’s next words.</P>

<P>&quot;This is the account of Maramar the Restless, who travelled the length and breadth of Middle Earth some centuries ago and wrote of his experiences on his return to Minas Tirith.  Listen to this: ‘I made my way east from the city, crossing the vast plains until I reached the Sea of Rhun.  There lies a forest on its furthest shores, and there I discovered the gardens of the Dryads, who once lived in Ithilien.  I presented myself to these legendary beings but they would not allow me entrance to their realm and instead sent me away.’ &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The Sea of Rhun?&quot; Merry questioned.  &quot;Where’s that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wait one moment,&quot; Hasilmir replied and disappeared round the corner of one of the bookcases.  He returned in a moment with another book, which he opened to a page that had a map of Middle Earth drawn upon it.  The Sea of Rhun was marked on the far edge of the parchment.</P>

<P>Merry judged the distance against how far they had already come.  &quot;I know I said there was nothing stopping us going to the other side of the world if we wanted to, Pip,&quot; he said, &quot;but I never thought we actually would!&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin’s mind was on something else Hasilmir had said.  &quot;They don’t sound very friendly, do they?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’m sure they’ll want to talk to us when we tell them why we’re there,&quot; Merry said brightly.  Then he turned to Hasilmir.  &quot;Thank you.  You’ve helped us a great deal.&quot;</P>

<P>The archivist grinned at them.  &quot;It was no trouble at all,&quot; he assured them.  &quot;I wish you the best of luck on your journey.  I do hope you will return to tell me it’s conclusion – it will make a wonderful entry in the chronicles.&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin did not have long to wait until the eagles returned with their friends.  Everyone was delighted to hear of the success of their search, but saddened to learn that they planned to leave for the next stage of their quest right away.  Legolas decided to stay in Minas Tirith but exhorted a promise from the hobbits that they would stop by on their way home to report back on what happened.</P>

<P>&quot;Don’t worry,&quot; Merry told him.  &quot;We’ve promised Hasilmir we’ll come back so he can write about our quest in his chronicle.&quot;  Then he turned to Finovar.  &quot;Will you mind setting off right away, when you’ve already been flying most of the day?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course not,&quot; the eagle replied.  &quot;We can fly for days at a time without any need to rest, Master Merry.  We are happy to depart as soon as you are ready.&quot;</P>

<P>Farewells were extended all round and the hobbits climbed aboard the basket once again.  They stayed at the edge and waved to their friends until they could no longer see them, then sat down together on the cushions.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, we’re off into the unknown now,&quot; Merry pointed out.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Pippin agreed.  &quot;The real adventure begins at last.  I wonder what the Entwives will be like.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry nodded.  &quot;I just hope they’re still there,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>True to their word, the eagles flew on through the night, and Merry found the slight rocking of the basket made it surprisingly easy to fall asleep.  He dreamed of lazy summer afternoons in the Shire, lying in a hammock stretched between two trees, and listening to the wind rustling through the leaves above his head.  Pippin was there, chasing butterflies in the long grass.  Suddenly, though, Pippin let out a great squawk and careened towards the hammock, colliding with Merry, tipping him unceremoniously to the ground and landing heavily on top of him.</P>

<P>When he opened his eyes, Merry found himself jammed into the corner of the basket, Pippin and the majority of their belongings squashing him.  He struggled vainly for a moment, until Pippin managed to roll off him and they both climbed unsteadily to their feet, clutching the sides of the basket and each other for support.  The sun had risen, but they could make out little of what lay below them as the basket swung wildly from side to side.</P>

<P>Looking up, Merry saw the eagles banking sharply and the reason became abundantly clear when some form of projectile whizzed through the air, narrowly missing Findroval’s outstretched wing.</P>

<P>&quot;We are being fired upon!&quot; Finovar called down to the hobbits.  &quot;Hold on!&quot;</P>

<P>The birds’ wingbeats increased in speed and the hobbits were thrown to the floor again.  They huddled together in alarm, helpless to do anything and baffled as to what kind of enemy they had stumbled across.</P>

<P>After only a few minutes, Merry felt the basket begin to descend, and they landed with a bump.  The two hobbits scrambled out to discover what was going on, and found themselves on the shore of a large lake.</P>

<P>&quot;Finovar!&quot; Merry cried, rushing up to the eagle, Pippin close on his heels.  &quot;What happened?  Are you both alright?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, Master Merry,&quot; the bird replied, breathlessly.  &quot;We are unhurt.  I believe they were warning shots only.  If these Entwives you seek are indeed elves, as your friend says, they would not have missed us unless it was intentional, and I do not think they would harm a living being without good reason.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It was the Entwives who attacked us?&quot; Pippin exclaimed with a worried glance at Merry.</P>

<P>&quot;We have reached the place you were told they inhabit,&quot; Finovar told them.  &quot;This is the Sea of Rhun and the trees on the far side mark the edges of the wood you described.  It would seem those you seek do not wish to be found.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Looks like we’re not going to get a very warm welcome, Pip,&quot; Merry said, and his cousin nodded.</P>

<P>&quot;You still wish to pursue your quest?&quot;  Finovar sounded concerned.</P>

<P>&quot;If we tell them why we’re here and they’re not interested, that’s one thing,&quot; Merry said firmly, &quot;but I’m not just going to turn around and go home without trying, just because they don’t like visitors.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Right,&quot; Pippin confirmed.  &quot;We owe it to Treebeard to at least try to talk to them.&quot;</P>

<P>Finovar bowed his head in acquiescence.  &quot;I am afraid you will have to go the rest of the way on foot,&quot; he said with obvious regret.  &quot;We cannot risk a real attack by approaching again from the air.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We would never ask you to put yourselves in danger,&quot; Merry assured him.  &quot;We’re more than grateful you’ve brought us this far.&quot;</P>

<P>He led Pippin back to the basket and they collected their packs, readying themselves for the long walk around the lake.</P>

<P>As they set out, Finovar called, &quot;Good luck!&quot; and they waved cheerily back.</P>

<P>However, once they were on their way, Pippin voiced his concerns.  &quot;Are you sure this is a good idea, Merry?&quot; he asked.  &quot;What if we get there and they shoot first and ask questions later?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You heard Finovar,&quot; Merry replied, trying to sound confident, even though he was feeling a little uncertain himself.  &quot;He didn’t think they were trying to hit us, just warning us away.  They should at least let us tell them why we’re here and show that we’re not a threat.&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin was unconvinced.  &quot;But what if they actually were trying to hit us?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In that case, we’re even better off,&quot; Merry said with a forced chuckle.  &quot;If they can’t hit two giant eagles, they’ll never be able to hit two tiny hobbits!  Don’t worry, Pip, I’m sure they’re lovely once you get to know them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Pippin countered, &quot;just so long as they give us the chance to find out…&quot;</P>

<P>They walked for a long time, scanning the landscape for possible threats but seeing nothing except rolling grasslands and the woods up ahead.  They made no attempt to hide their own passage, thinking it safer to approach openly than appear to be sneaking.</P>

<P>It took them both completely by surprise when an arrow suddenly thwacked into the ground just in front of Pippin’s feet.  He yelped and leapt backwards, crashing into Merry and sending them both tumbling to the ground.  When they looked up, they saw a figure standing over them, and a cocked bow aiming directly at them.  The figure had bare feet and legs, a definitely female torso covered by a simple shift, clearly elven features and a head of flowing, dark blonde hair.  The only thing that set her apart from the other elves the hobbits had met was her skin, which was a burnished brown.</P>

<P>She glared down at them and demanded, &quot;What manner of beings are you, and why do you trespass within our borders?&quot;</P>

<P>Merry refused to be fazed by her hostility, instead climbing slowly to his feet and helping Pippin up before turning to face their interrogator with a calm demeanour.</P>

<P>&quot;We are hobbits,&quot; he said, &quot;and, if you are who we think you are, we have come to talk to you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hobbits…&quot;  The Entwife, for that must be what she was, said the word as if trying it out.  &quot;I do not remember any mention of hobbits in the old lists.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That’s exactly what Treebeard said!&quot; Pippin piped up.  &quot;He decided we must be newer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Treebeard?&quot; the Entwife questioned, starting at the name.  &quot;You know the master of Fangorn?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Merry replied.  &quot;That’s why we are here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I must take you to Fimbrethil,&quot; the Entwife determined.  &quot;She will want to speak with you.&quot;  She gestured with her bow that they should precede her, and they started to move towards the trees.</P>

<P>&quot;Fimbrethil,&quot; Pippin repeated softly to Merry.  &quot;That’s the name Treebeard mentioned when he was talking about searching for the Entwives.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, Pip, I know,&quot; Merry agreed.  &quot;Things are looking up again.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Pippin murmured with a worried glance over his shoulder at the arrow that was still aimed at them.</P>

<P>They reached the treeline and moved into the shade provided by the leaf canopy.  A short distance in, the sight that greeted them almost made them forget about their slightly precarious circumstances; it was so unexpected and breathtaking.  Almost immediately, the trees opened out again to form a protective ring around a beautiful garden of brightly coloured flowers.  At the far end, a different sort of smaller tree clustered together, forming walls with their trunks and a roof with their intertwined branches, creating a little house.  In front of the building, if it could be called that, there stood a great boulder with a smooth top that evidently served as a table.  Several other sturdy plants grew around it in the shape of what could only be seats.  The grass had flattened and woven itself together to provide a path through the flowers that led up to the table.</P>

<P>&quot;Fimbrethil!&quot; their escort called out, and another Entwife emerged from the building.  She looked much the same as the first, except that Merry thought she seemed older and her golden hair was straighter.</P>

<P>&quot;I found these creatures walking on the shores of the lake.  They call themselves hobbits and they say they know Treebeard.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry stepped forward and bowed before Fimbrethil.  &quot;My name is Meriadoc Brandybuck,&quot; he said, &quot;and I have travelled with my cousin, Peregrin Took, from the other side of the world to speak with you.  Please grant us an audience.&quot;</P>

<P>Fimbrethil looked stunned for a moment, then gestured to the other Entwife, who was still standing behind them.</P>

<P>&quot;I do not believe them to be dangerous,&quot; she said.  &quot;I will hear what they have to say.  You may leave us.&quot;</P>

<P>Their escort turned and melted back into the trees without a word, while Fimbrethil took a seat at the table and motioned for the hobbits to join her.</P>

<P>&quot;Tell me your tale,&quot; she said simply, once they were settled.</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin exchanged glances.  Fimbrethil exuded a kind of cold authority, her manner remote and her expression closed.  It was not a reception that was conducive to tale-telling, but Merry refused once again to be discouraged, instead taking a deep breath and meeting the Entwife’s gaze levelly.  He decided to keep things simple.</P>

<P>&quot;Some years ago, we met an Ent named Treebeard in Fangorn Forest and he told us there would be no more Ents because they had lost their Entwives.  When we parted, he asked us to send word if we ever heard anything about the Entwives, but we decided to take it one step further and come looking for you ourselves.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And so, at long last, we are found,&quot; Fimbrethil mused.  Then her tone hardened.  &quot;Why does Treebeard send you as his messengers?  Why does he not come to plead his case himself?&quot;</P>

<P>Pippin took up the thread.  &quot;He said he had travelled as far as The Brown Lands looking for you, but didn’t know where to go from there.  He decided there were too many men taking up the world to explore further, so he went back to Fangorn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It was men, and worse, that drove us from our homes in that region.  That is why we came here,&quot; Fimbrethil explained, &quot;to escape a growing threat from Mordor.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But that threat is now gone,&quot; Merry told her.  &quot;The One Ring has been destroyed and Sauron defeated once and for all.  We know – we were there.&quot;</P>

<P>The raising of one eyebrow betrayed Fimbrethil’s interest in this news.  &quot;We felt a shifting in the land some time ago,&quot; she said, &quot;and wondered at it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you see, it’s safe now,&quot; Pippin pointed out.  &quot;You can come back.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nay,&quot; she replied, &quot;we have no desire to rejoin the other races in the world.  Our time here is coming to an end, and the sea calls us to leave Middle Earth and travel to Valinor.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Legolas told us you’d say that,&quot; Merry muttered.</P>

<P>&quot;Legolas?&quot; Fimbrethil queried.</P>

<P>Pippin explained.  &quot;The elf prince of Mirkwood.  He helped us find you.&quot;</P>

<P>Again, the eyebrow rose skyward.  &quot;You have interesting friends for such younglings.  And what the elf prince said is true.  We may have secluded ourselves from our people but we are still elves, and the call of the sea is difficult to resist.  I see no reason for us to do so when we have no purpose to serve here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you do have a purpose!&quot; Merry argued.  &quot;The Ents need you!  They’re dying out and they can’t survive unless you go back and create more of them.&quot;  Fimbrethil seemed indifferent to his outburst, so he tried another line of thought.  &quot;You’re immortal, right?&quot;  She nodded.  &quot;And the Undying Lands presumably aren’t going anywhere, right?&quot;  Another nod.  &quot;So, they’ll still be there in a couple more centuries, won’t they?  The war may be over, but the lands to the West have suffered much, and the Ents can’t heal them by themselves.  How can you abandon them to die, when you have the power to help them?&quot;</P>

<P>Fimbrethil was silent for a moment.  When she spoke, her tone was softer and more thoughtful than before.  &quot;There is wisdom in your words, little one, and you remind me that we have been neglectful of our duties for a long time.  However, the warring of men was not why we left the Ents in the first place.  There were other reasons that have not been resolved.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry thought back to what Treebeard had told them about the Entwives’ differing views on cultivating the land.  He was struck suddenly by the absurdity of a hobbit sitting in a garden on the far side of the world, mediating what was essentially a millennia old lovers’ quarrel.  He felt a similar sense of frustration building within him as when he had attempted to persuade the Ents to join the war.</P>

<P>&quot;Surely the survival of the Ents is more important than a disagreement over the best way to grow flowers!&quot; he exclaimed, temporarily letting his temper get the better of him.</P>

<P>Fimbrethil’s manner grew frosty.  &quot;You speak of things you do not understand, hobbit,&quot; she warned.</P>

<P>Merry sighed and calmed himself.  &quot;My apologies,&quot; he said.  &quot;It’s just that Treebeard is our friend and we want to help him.&quot;</P>

<P>Silence reigned for a moment as the discussion ground to halt, Merry unsure what else he could say to convince Fimbrethil.</P>

<P>It was Pippin who spoke next.  &quot;The Ents like to live deep in the untamed forest, and you like to live in gardens you create,&quot; he said, as if thinking out loud.  &quot;There must be places where you could both be happy, and closer together than Fangorn and the Sea of Rhun.  Take the Shire, for example – that’s where we hobbits live.  The Old Forest is just as wild and scary as Fangorn – I’m sure the Ents would be quite at home there.  And there’s the Brandywine River that runs along the edge – that’s surrounded by just the type of land that could be made into beautiful gardens like this.&quot;</P>

<P>Fimbrethil considered his words, then rose abruptly from the table.  &quot;You have given me much to think on,&quot; she said, looking down at the hobbits.  &quot;I must discuss this matter with my sisters.  You will remain here and food will be brought to you&quot;</P>

<P>With that, she spun on her heel and disappeared into the trees.</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Merry when she had gone.  &quot;What do you make of that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;At least we’re getting fed,&quot; was Pippin’s only comment.</P>

<P>Sure enough, only a few minutes had passed when two Entwives they had not seen before emerged from behind the house and laid out a selection of food in front of them before leaving the way they had come.  The hobbits tucked in.</P>

<P>&quot;I do hope the Entwives don’t take as long to make decisions as the Ents do,&quot; Pippin remarked around a mouthful of food.</P>

<P>Merry simply nodded his agreement.</P>

<P>They needn’t have worried.  Just as they were finishing the last of the food, Fimbrethil reappeared and approached the table, the Entwife who had threatened the hobbits at the lake following behind her.</P>

<P>&quot;We have come to an agreement,&quot; Fimbrethil told them.  &quot;You are right in that we are needed in the world again, but we are not sure we wish to stay.  Since we are soon to be travelling west anyway, we will visit Fangorn on our journey and make cuttings for the Ents while we are there.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry was going to interrupt to ask what she meant, but then decided he probably didn’t really want to know.</P>

<P>Fimbrethil continued.  &quot;We will speak with Treebeard and perhaps consider this land you have recommended.&quot;</P>

<P>The other Entwife stepped forward.  &quot;I will now take you back to the edge of our lands.&quot;</P>

<P>Merry and Pippin gathered this meant they were dismissed, so they grabbed their packs and scrambled to follow their escort as she led them back through the trees.  She left them on the shores of the lake, but stood watching as they made their way back towards the eagles, as if making sure they were really leaving.  Merry reflected that he was glad he wouldn’t be present for the reunion of the Ents with the Entwives; he got the impression the meeting wouldn’t be all hugs and kisses.  They had at least found the Entwives and got them to agree to go to Fangorn, though – the rest would be up to Treebeard.</P>

<P>Merry turned to Pippin as they walked.  &quot;I’d say that’s mission accomplished, wouldn’t you?&quot; he said.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Pippin agreed, &quot;and in only five days, too!&quot;  He looked thoughtful for a moment, then continued, &quot;Sam’s not expecting us back for months and the eagles seem quite happy to ferry us about, so – where to do you want to go next?&quot;</P>
